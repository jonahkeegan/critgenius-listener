## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Information Architecture

- [x] Create refactoring-progress.md tracker
- [ ] Create refactoring-learnings.md for insights
- [ ] Map exact row ranges for each new file
- [ ] Review comprehensive-testing-guide.md structure

### Phase 2: File Creation

- [ ] Create testing-overview.md (foundation/entry point)
- [ ] Create testing-workflows.md (depends on overview)
- [ ] Create testing-infrastructure.md (technical deep dive)
- [ ] Create testing-utilities.md (API reference)
- [ ] Create integration-testing-handbook.md (specialized patterns)
- [ ] Create performance-testing-guide.md (specialized patterns)
- [ ] Create testing-validation.md (quality gates)

### Phase 3: Cross-Reference Updates

- [ ] Add "Related Documentation" sections to all new files
- [ ] Search for references to comprehensive-testing-guide.md
- [ ] Update all documentation cross-references
- [ ] Verify no broken links remain

### Phase 4: Cleanup & Validation

- [ ] Verify all content migrated (row count check)
- [ ] Delete comprehensive-testing-guide.md
