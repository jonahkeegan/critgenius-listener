1. **Technology Stack Validation**: Context7 analysis confirms AssemblyAI Node SDK and Web Audio API
   as technically sound choices with excellent documentation quality
2. **Architecture Enhancement**: Implement comprehensive sequence diagram documentation and
   systematic component interaction patterns
3. **Implementation Strategy**: Establish test-driven development framework with comprehensive
   quality gates
4. **Risk Management**: Address real-time processing challenges with systematic mitigation
   strategies
