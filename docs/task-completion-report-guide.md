## Overview & Philosophy

### Core Principles

Task completion reports serve three critical functions in the CritGenius Listener development
workflow:

1. **Documentation**: Creating a permanent, searchable record of what was accomplished
2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Enabling future developers (human or AI) to understand decisions and
   implementations
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Feeding the memory bank system with learnings and patterns

### The Three Pillars

**Conciseness**: Default to the simplest format that captures essential information. Avoid
information overload while ensuring actionability.

**Actionability**: Every report must enable future work continuation through specific file paths,
validation commands, and observable outcomes.

**Memory Bank Integration**: Reports directly feed into the continuous improvement protocol defined
in `.clinerules/07-cline-continuous-improvement-protocol.md`, providing raw material for:

- `memory-bank/raw_reflection_log.md` entries
- `memory-bank/progress-XXX.md` task records
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns-XXX.md` pattern documentation
- `memory-bank/consolidated-learnings-XXX.md` distilled insights

### Task Completion Lifecycle

```sequenceDiagram
participant Developer
participant TaskExecution
participant CompletionReport
participant RawLog as raw_reflection_log.md
participant ProgressLog as progress-XXX.md
participant ConsolidatedLearnings
participant FeatureBranch

Developer->>TaskExecution: Complete task
TaskExecution->>CompletionReport: Write completion report
CompletionReport->>RawLog: Extract learnings & reflections
CompletionReport->>ProgressLog: Create progress entry
RawLog->>ConsolidatedLearnings: Periodic consolidation
CompletionReport->>FeatureBranch: Create feature branch (if needed)
FeatureBranch->>Developer: Ready for PR workflow
```

### Connection to Continuous Improvement Protocol

This guide implements **Step 1.1 (Task Review & Analysis)** of the continuous improvement protocol:

- **Identify Learnings**: What new information, techniques, or patterns were discovered?
- **Identify Difficulties**: What challenges were faced and how were they resolved?
- **Identify Successes**: What strategies or tools were notably effective?

The completion report captures this raw data, which then flows into Step 1.2 (Logging to
raw_reflection_log.md) and subsequent steps.

## Report Selection Matrix

### Complexity Assessment

Choose the appropriate report format based on task complexity, measured across multiple dimensions:

| Dimension                 | Simple      | Medium       | Complex       |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| **Files Changed**         | 1-3         | 4-10         | 10+           |
| **Lines of Code**         | <100        | 100-500      | 500+          |
| **New Patterns**          | 0           | 1-2          | 3+            |
| **Documentation Created** | 0-1         | 2-3          | 4+            |
| **Test Files Added**      | 0-1         | 2-4          | 5+            |
| **Architectural Impact**  | None        | Local        | System-wide   |
| **Report Length**         | 15-30 lines | 50-150 lines | 150-400 lines |

### Complexity Scoring

Assign points based on criteria:

- **Files Changed**: 1-3 files = 1pt, 4-10 = 2pts, 10+ = 3pts
- **Lines of Code**: <100 = 1pt, 100-500 = 2pts, 500+ = 3pts
- **New Patterns**: 0 = 1pt, 1-2 = 2pts, 3+ = 3pts
- **Documentation**: 0-1 docs = 1pt, 2-3 = 2pts, 4+ = 3pts
- **Architectural Impact**: None = 1pt, Local = 2pts, System-wide = 3pts

**Total Score:**

- **5-7 points**: Use Concise Format
- **8-11 points**: Use Structured Format
- **12-15 points**: Use Comprehensive Format

- Tasks completing in <2 hours

### Required Sections

1. **Summary** (2-3 bullet points)
2. **Files Changed** (bulleted list with paths)
3. **Validation** (commands executed)
4. **Follow-up Recommendations** (optional, 1-2 items)

### Template

```markdown
# Task Completion Report – [Task ID]: [Task Title]

## Summary

- [Specific action 1 with file/component name]
- [Specific action 2 with observable outcome]
- [Task completion marker in tracking system]

## Files Changed

- `path/to/file1.ts`
- `path/to/file2.md`
- `path/to/file3.test.ts`

## Validation

- `pnpm command to verify change`

## Follow-up Recommendations

1. [Optional enhancement or future consideration]
```

### Real Example from Project

From `task-completion-reports/2025-10-23-dev-infra-3-3-4-ci-eslint-workflow-guard.md`:

```markdown
# Task Completion Report – Dev Infra 3.3.4: CI ESLint Workflow Guard

## Summary

- Added `tests/infrastructure/ci-eslint-integration.test.ts` to assert the CI lint stage builds
  dependencies first, respects accessibility rules, and fails on warnings or missing guards.
- Authored `docs/ci-eslint-integration.md` documenting lint guard expectations, troubleshooting
  guidance, and local reproduction steps.
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `scripts/lint-ci.mjs` to align with the test assertions and
  ensure lint validation stays ordered after the bootstrap phase.
- Marked task 3.3.4 complete in `tasks/infrastructure-setup-task-list.md` and reran the full
  infrastructure suite to confirm workspace stability.

## Files Changed

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `scripts/lint-ci.mjs`
- `tests/infrastructure/ci-eslint-integration.test.ts`
- `docs/ci-eslint-integration.md`
- `tasks/infrastructure-setup-task-list.md`

## Validation

- `pnpm run test:infrastructure`

## Follow-up Recommendations

1. Mirror these assertions in any future GitHub Actions workflows (e.g., release or nightly
   pipelines) to catch regressions outside the main CI path.
```

### Best Practices for Concise Format

**DO:**

- ✅ Include specific file paths in summary
- ✅ State observable outcomes

### Real Example from Project

From `task-completion-reports/2025-09-20-dev-infra-2-10-2-2-centralized-proxy-registry.md`:

```markdown
# Task Completion Report — Dev Infra: 2.10.2-2 Centralized Proxy Registry

Date: 2025-09-20 Branch: feat/dev-infra/2-10-2-https-proxy-hardening Author: Automation via VS Code
agent (paired with Jonah)

## Summary

This report documents the Centralized Proxy Registry (Task 2.10.2-2), which improves maintainability
and consistency of the dev proxy by introducing a single source of truth for routes and environment
keys, and refactoring the client proxy builder to consume it. The change preserves existing behavior
and prepares the path for automatic docs/template generation.

## Artifacts Changed

- Shared
  - `packages/shared/src/config/proxyRegistry.ts` — NEW: `PROXY_ROUTES`, `PROXY_ENV_KEYS`,
    `resolveTargetFromEnv`, and `getProxyRegistry()`
  - `packages/shared/src/config/proxyRegistry.test.ts` — NEW: unit tests
  - `packages/shared/src/index.ts` — Export registry from shared entry for source imports
  - `packages/shared/package.json` — Added subpath export `"./config/proxyRegistry"`

- Client
  - `packages/client/src/config/devProxy.ts` — Refactored to use registry for env keys and routes;
    preserved existing behavior

## Implementation Details

// Centralized Proxy Registry

- Routes: `/api` (HTTP), `/socket.io` (WS), optional AssemblyAI proxy mount
- Keys: `DEV_PROXY_*` keys consolidated, including HTTPS and discovery flags
- Helper: `resolveTargetFromEnv` to derive protocol/port consistently
- Client proxy builder now iterates registry routes and applies correct headers/agents/secure flags
- Backward compatibility maintained; AssemblyAI rewrite unchanged

## Tests & Validation

- Lint: PASS (zero warnings enforced)
- Type-check: PASS across shared, server, and client
- Client tests: PASS (8 passed | 1 skipped) including proxy config and discovery path unaffected
- Shared tests: PASS (registry tests included)
- Root tests: PASS (docs + orchestration scenarios green with expected negative-path warnings)

## Security & Privacy

- No secrets logged; sanitized summaries only
- Localhost-only probing; strict timeouts
- HTTPS-aware proxy with host allowlist and optional TLS relax (dev-only)
- Backward compatible defaults, explicit opt-in for HTTPS and discovery

## Developer Experience

- Faster startup with less manual configuration
- Single source of truth for proxy routes and env keys
- Registry enables future generators (docs, .env templates) and easier maintenance

## Follow-Ups (Optional)

- Generators:
  - `scripts/generate-proxy-docs.mjs` → `docs/development-proxy.routes.md`
  - `scripts/generate-proxy-env-example.mjs` → update `.env.example` selectively
  - Add a minimal doc test asserting the generated table shape
- Integration test across multiple candidate ports and HTTPS
```

### Best Practices for Structured Format

**DO:**

- ✅ Organize artifacts by logical grouping (package, module, doc type)
- ✅ Explain "why" decisions were made, not just "what"
- ✅ Include all validation commands with pass/fail results
- ✅ Document security/privacy considerations explicitly
- ✅ Highlight developer experience improvements

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Include entire code files or massive diffs
- ❌ Skip test results or validation evidence
- ❌ Write generic follow-ups ("improve performance")
- ❌ Exceed 150 lines total

````

**Example (Bad):**
```markdown
## Follow-ups
- Make it better
- Improve performance
- Add tests
````

---

## Anti-Pattern Examples

### Anti-Pattern 1: Vague Summary

**Example from project history** (dev-infra-task-1-4-completion-report.md - improved version):

**❌ Bad:**

```markdown
## Summary

Task 1.4 has been successfully completed using the GitHub MCP.
```

**Why Wrong:** Generic statement with no specifics about what was accomplished or what files were
affected.

**✅ Good:**

```markdown
## Summary

- ✅ Created initial README.md file in main branch to establish repository content
- ✅ Created `develop` branch from `main` using GitHub MCP create_branch tool
- ✅ Created `staging` branch from `main` using GitHub MCP create_branch tool
- ✅ Updated infrastructure setup task list to mark task 1.4 as completed
```

**Why Better:** Specific actions with file/branch names and tool references make it clear what was
accomplished.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Missing Validation Commands

**Hypothetical example:**

**❌ Bad:**

```markdown
## Validation

Everything works correctly. All tests passed.
```

**Why Wrong:** No commands provided to verify the claims; future developers can't reproduce
validation.

**✅ Good:**

```markdown
## Validation

- `pnpm run test:infrastructure` — PASS (23/23 tests)
- `pnpm lint` — PASS (0 warnings)
- `pnpm type-check` — PASS (0 errors)
- `pnpm test:coverage:thematic` — PASS (coverage gates met)
```

**Why Better:** Exact commands with results enable reproducible verification.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Overly Detailed for Simple Task

**Hypothetical example of wrong format choice:**

**❌ Bad (using Comprehensive format for simple task):**

```markdown
# Task Completion Report: Fix Typo in README

**Date:** 2025-10-24 **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive report documents the correction of a critical typographical error discovered in
the project's primary documentation file...

## Objectives Achieved

✅ Identified typo through documentation review ✅ Implemented correction using industry best
practices ✅ Validated change through peer review process

## Technical Implementation Details

The implementation required careful analysis of the existing documentation structure... [... 300
more lines ...]
```

**Why Wrong:** Massive overhead for trivial change; wastes time reading irrelevant detail.

**✅ Good (using Concise format):**

```markdown
# Task Completion Report – Doc Fix: README Typo

## Summary

- Fixed typo in README.md: "recieve" → "receive"

## Files Changed

- `README.md`

## Validation

- Visual inspection confirmed correction
```

**Why Better:** Appropriate detail level for scope of change.

### Anti-Pattern 4: No Connection to Memory Bank

**❌ Bad:**

```markdown
# Task Completion Report – Dev Infra 3.2.1: Coverage Gates

## Summary

- Updated coverage configuration
- Fixed tests

## Files Changed

- `config/coverage.config.mjs`
- `tests/infrastructure/vitest-config-consistency.test.ts`

## Validation

- `pnpm test:infrastructure`
```

**Why Wrong:** No identification of learnings, patterns, or insights for memory bank; misses
opportunity for knowledge capture.

**✅ Good:**

```markdown
# Task Completion Report – Dev Infra 3.2.1: Coverage Gate Calibration

## Summary

- Updated workspace coverage threshold to 9% in `config/coverage.config.mjs`
- Aligned infrastructure test assertions with new threshold
- Validated thematic coverage suite passes under relaxed gate

## Files Changed

- `config/coverage.config.mjs`
- `tests/infrastructure/vitest-config-consistency.test.ts`

## Validation

- `pnpm test:infrastructure` — PASS
- `pnpm test:coverage:thematic` — PASS

## Learnings for Memory Bank

- **Pattern Identified**: Centralized coverage thresholds in shared config prevent drift
- **Success**: Single source of truth approach caught misalignment before CI failure
- **Improvement**: Automated consistency checks maintain accuracy across test files
```

**Why Better:** Explicitly identifies learnings and patterns for continuous improvement protocol.

## Memory Bank Integration

### Overview

Task completion reports serve as the primary input for the continuous improvement protocol defined
in `.clinerules/07-cline-continuous-improvement-protocol.md`. This section explains how report
content flows into memory bank files.

### Identifying Patterns for systemPatterns-XXX.md

**Criteria for pattern extraction:**
1. **Reusability**: Can this approach be applied to other scenarios?
2. **Generalizability**: Does it address a class of problems, not just one instance?
3. **Value**: Does it provide significant benefit or solve a real pain point?
4. **Actionability**: Can someone implement this based on the description?

**Sources of patterns in reports:**
- Implementation Details → Technical patterns
- Developer Experience → Workflow patterns
- Tests & Validation → Quality assurance patterns
- Challenges Overcome → Problem-solving patterns
- Security & Privacy → Security patterns

**Example pattern extraction:**

From report "Centralized Proxy Registry":
```markdown
## Pattern: Single Source of Truth for Configuration

**Context:** When multiple files reference the same configuration values (routes, env keys, ports)

**Problem:** Configuration drift occurs when values are duplicated; updates miss locations causing inconsistencies

**Solution:** Create centralized registry module exporting all configuration values; consuming modules import from single source

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates drift through single update point
- Enables automated documentation generation
- Simplifies validation and testing

**Implementation Notes:**
- Create registry file in shared package
- Export as const objects
- Provide helper functions for common derivations
- Document in module docstrings

**Validation:** `pnpm test` verifies consumers use registry values

**Related Patterns:** See [Centralized Coverage Configuration](#centralized-coverage-configuration)

## Feature Branch Creation

### Branch Naming Convention

**Format:** `feat/[category]/[task-id]-[brief-description]`

**Components:**

- `feat/` - Prefix indicating feature branch
- `[category]` - dev-infra, ui, api, docs, test, etc.
- `[task-id]` - Task identifier from tracking system
- `[brief-description]` - Hyphenated description (2-5 words)

**Examples from project:**

- `feat/dev-infra/3-3-4-ci-eslint-workflow-guard`
- `feat/dev-infra/2-10-2-https-proxy-hardening`
- `feat/dev-infra/3-1-5-comprehensive-testing-guide`

### Branch Creation Workflow

1. **Complete the task** and verify all changes work
2. **Write completion report** following appropriate template
3. **Extract branch name** from task ID and summary
4. **Create and push branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/[category]/[task-id]-[brief-description]
   git add .
   git commit -m "[Task ID]: [Commit message]"
   git push origin feat/[category]/[task-id]-[brief-description]
   ```
5. **Update memory bank** with learnings
6. **Create pull request** referencing completion report

### Linking Reports to Branches

## Integration Guidelines

### Relationship to Other Documentation

This guide works in concert with several other project documentation files:

**Primary Integration:**

- **`.clinerules/07-cline-continuous-improvement-protocol.md`**: This guide implements Step 1.1
  (Task Review & Analysis) of the protocol. Reports provide raw material for Step 1.2 (Logging to
  raw_reflection_log.md).
- **`docs/memory-bank-update-guide.md`**: Use completion reports as input for memory bank updates
  following the detailed workflow in that guide.

**Supporting Integration:**

- **`docs/development-workflow.md`**: Reports document completion of workflow stages
- **`docs/comprehensive-testing-guide.md`**: Validation sections reference testing standards
- **`docs/testing-standards.md`**: Test file naming follows these conventions
- **`docs/integration-test-patterns.md`**: Integration testing results documented in reports

### When to Write Reports

**Mandatory:**

- ✅ After every task completion (before `attempt_completion`)
- ✅ Before creating feature branch for PR
- ✅ When updating memory bank with learnings
- ✅ As part of CI/CD documentation requirements

**Optional but Recommended:**

- ⚠️ After significant debugging sessions (document solution)
- ⚠️ When discovering reusable patterns mid-task
- ⚠️ After user feedback requires major changes

**Not Required:**

- ❌ During active task execution (wait until completion)
- ❌ For work-in-progress experimental branches
- ❌ For abandoned or rolled-back changes

### Report Storage and Organization

**Location:** `task-completion-reports/`

**Naming Convention:** `YYYY-MM-DD-[task-id]-[brief-description].md`

- Date: Use current date in PST timezone
- Task ID: From tracking system (e.g., `dev-infra-3-3-4`)
- Description: 2-5 hyphenated words summarizing task

**Retention Policy:**

- Keep all reports indefinitely as historical record
- No archiving or deletion (valuable for project history)
- Reports serve as permanent documentation

**Search and Discovery:**

- Task ID in filename enables quick search: `grep -r "3-3-4" task-completion-reports/`
- Date enables chronological browsing
- Git history preserves report evolution

### GPT-5 Copilot Instructions

**YOU MUST:**

- ✅ Write completion report before using `attempt_completion` tool
- ✅ Select format based on complexity matrix (not personal preference)
- ✅ Extract learnings explicitly for memory bank integration
- ✅ Include all validation commands executed
- ✅ Use appropriate sequence diagrams for complex workflows
- ✅ Reference this guide when uncertain about format or content

**YOU MUST NEVER:**

- ❌ Skip completion report for "simple" tasks
- ❌ Use wrong format template (e.g., comprehensive for bug fix)
- ❌ Omit validation commands or file paths
- ❌ Write generic summaries without specifics
- ❌ Fail to connect report to memory bank updates
- ❌ Create report after memory bank update (order matters)

**Decision Protocol:**

1. Complete task and verify all changes work
2. Calculate complexity score using matrix
3. Select appropriate template (concise/structured/comprehensive)
4. Write report following template exactly
5. Extract learnings for raw_reflection_log.md
6. Create progress-XXX.md entry
7. Update memory bank per protocol
8. Use `attempt_completion` tool

**Quality Assurance:**

- Verify all required sections present
- Check file paths are accurate
- Confirm validation commands execute successfully
- Ensure learnings are explicitly identified
- Cross-reference with memory bank update guide

### Workflow Integration

**Standard Task Completion Flow:**

1. **Task Execution** → Complete implementation
2. **Validation** → Run all test commands
3. **Completion Report** → Write using this guide ← YOU ARE HERE
4. **Memory Bank Update** → Follow memory-bank-update-guide.md
5. **Feature Branch** → Create branch with conventional naming
6. **Pull Request** → Reference report in PR description
7. **Task Tracking** → Mark task complete in tracking system

**Critical Ordering:**

- Report BEFORE memory bank update (provides input)
- Memory bank update BEFORE `attempt_completion` (protocol requirement)
- Validation BEFORE report writing (ensure accuracy)

### Version History

```markdown
## Implementation Details

I created a file and put some code in it. Then I updated another file to use that code.
```

### Capturing Follow-ups

**Purpose:** Document future work opportunities

**Best Practices:**

- Be specific about future work
- Reference related task IDs if known
- Distinguish required vs. optional
- Provide rationale for each item
