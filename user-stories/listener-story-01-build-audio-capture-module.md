# User Story: Audio Capture Module for D&D Sessions

## 1. User Story Narrative

**As a** D&D player participating in live tabletop roleplaying sessions,  
**I want** to seamlessly capture audio from my microphone during gameplay,  
**so that** my voice and character interactions can be automatically transcribed and mapped without
disrupting the immersive storytelling experience.

## 2. Background/Context

Audio capture serves as the foundational technology for CritGenius: Listener's core value
proposition - real-time speaker-to-character mapping and live transcription. This capability enables
the system to:

- Build voice profiles for accurate speaker identification
- Support real-time transcription during active gameplay
- Provide the audio stream foundation for AI-powered session augmentation
- Enable accessibility features for hearing-impaired players

**Business Value:** This module is the critical first component that enables all downstream features
including speaker diarization, character mapping, and AI-driven session enhancement.

**Dependencies:** Web Audio API browser support, user permission management, React/Material-UI
components for user interface.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (Testable Requirements)

### Happy Path: Successful Audio Capture

**Given** a D&D player on the session page with a working microphone,  
**When** they click the "Start Recording" button,  
**Then** the system should request microphone permission,  
**And** upon permission grant, begin capturing audio stream,  
**And** display a visual indicator showing active recording status,  
**And** make the audio stream available for real-time processing.

**Given** an active audio recording session,  
**When** the player clicks the "Stop Recording" button,  
**Then** the audio capture should immediately cease,  
**And** the visual indicator should update to show inactive status,  
**And** any buffered audio should be properly finalized.

### Permission Management Scenarios

**Given** a user on the session page,  
**When** they click "Start Recording" for the first time,  
**Then** the browser should display a microphone permission prompt,  
**And** the UI should show a "requesting permission" status message.

**Given** a user who previously denied microphone permission,  
**When** they click "Start Recording",  
**Then** the system should detect the denied permission,  
**And** display clear instructions for enabling microphone access,  
**And** provide a retry mechanism after permission is granted.

**Given** an active recording session,  
**When** the user revokes microphone permission through browser settings,  
**Then** the recording should automatically stop,  
**And** the user should be notified that permission was revoked,  
**And** the UI should return to the initial state.

### Error Handling and Unsupported Devices

**Given** a user with an unsupported browser,  
**When** they attempt to access the audio capture feature,  
**Then** the system should detect Web Audio API unavailability,  
**And** display a clear message about browser compatibility,  
**And** provide recommendations for supported browsers.

**Given** a user with no microphone connected,  
**When** they click "Start Recording",  
**Then** the system should detect the missing audio input device,  
**And** display a helpful error message about microphone requirements,  
**And** provide troubleshooting guidance.

**Given** an active recording session,  
**When** a network connectivity issue occurs,  
**Then** the local audio capture should continue uninterrupted,  
**And** the system should buffer audio locally,  
**And** attempt to resume processing when connectivity is restored.

### Audio Stream Quality and Processing

**Given** successful audio capture initiation,  
**When** the user speaks into their microphone,  
**Then** the audio stream should maintain consistent quality levels,  
**And** audio levels should be visually displayed to the user,  
**And** the stream should be available for immediate processing by transcription services.

**Given** an active audio stream,  
**When** audio levels are too low or too high,  
**Then** the system should provide visual feedback about audio levels,  
**And** offer guidance for optimal microphone positioning.

### UI/UX Requirements

**Given** any state of the audio capture system,  
**When** the user views the interface,  
**Then** the current recording status should be immediately apparent,  
**And** all controls should be clearly labeled and accessible,  
**And** error messages should be user-friendly and actionable.

**Given** the recording is active,  
**When** the user attempts to navigate away from the page,  
**Then** the system should warn about losing the recording session,  
**And** provide options to stop recording or continue in background if supported.

## 4. Technical Implementation Notes

**Target Technologies:**

- Web Audio API for browser-based microphone access
- React components with Material-UI for user interface
- Real-time audio stream processing capability
- Integration points for AssemblyAI transcription service

**Performance Requirements:**

- Sub-200ms latency from permission grant to audio capture start
- Minimal CPU overhead for continuous audio streaming
- Graceful handling of long recording sessions (2+ hours)

## 5. Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria pass automated tests
- [ ] Unit tests cover all error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end audio capture flow
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Accessibility testing confirms WCAG compliance
- [ ] Performance testing validates resource usage under load
- [ ] Code review completed and documentation updated
- [ ] User experience testing with actual D&D players confirms intuitive operation

## 6. Sizing and Estimation

**Story Points:** 8 (Large - requires comprehensive error handling and cross-browser compatibility)

**Estimation Rationale:**

- Web Audio API integration: Medium complexity
- Permission management flows: Medium complexity
- Error handling for multiple scenarios: High complexity
- Cross-browser compatibility testing: Medium complexity
- UI/UX implementation with real-time feedback: Medium complexity

## 7. TDD Implementation Order

1. **Red Phase:** Write failing test for basic microphone permission request
2. **Green Phase:** Implement minimal code to request and handle microphone permission
3. **Refactor Phase:** Clean up permission handling code structure
4. **Red Phase:** Write failing test for audio stream capture
5. **Green Phase:** Implement basic audio stream capture from granted microphone
6. **Refactor Phase:** Optimize stream handling and resource management
7. **Repeat cycle** for each acceptance criterion until all scenarios pass
