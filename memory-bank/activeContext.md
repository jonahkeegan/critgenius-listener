### Latest Updates (2025-10-13 – Centralized Coverage Configuration)

- COVERAGE ORCHESTRATION SINGLE SOURCE (Task 3.2.1.1)
  - Introduced `config/coverage.config.mjs` with typed exports (`coverage.config.types.ts`, `.d.ts`) as the authoritative home for thresholds, target metadata, report directories, and helper utilities consumed by coverage scripts, Vitest configs, and tests.
  - Refactored `scripts/coverage/run-coverage.mjs`, `scripts/coverage/thematic-summary.mjs`, root/package `vitest.config.ts`, and infrastructure suites to import the shared module via `pathToFileURL`, eliminating duplicate literals and resolving the earlier `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME` regression.
  - Hardened infrastructure drift detection by asserting coverage expectations directly against the shared module (`coverage-thresholds`, `coverage-validation`), and documented the watchexec-based watch loop (`~/.cargo/bin/watchexec.exe … -- pnpm vitest run …`) for fast verification from the repo root.
  - Validation: `pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure/coverage-thresholds.test.ts tests/infrastructure/coverage-validation.test.ts`.

### Latest Updates (2025-10-12 – Tiered Coverage Enforcement & ESLint Stability)

- COVERAGE GOVERNANCE & QUALITY GATES (Task 3.2.1 Tiered Coverage Enforcement)
  - Embedded the tiered coverage policy (Shared ≥75 %, Client/Server ≥50 %, Workspace & Test-Utils ≥30 %) inside every `vitest.config.ts`, guarded by updated infrastructure suites (`coverage-validation`, new `coverage-thresholds`, and refreshed config consistency checks) plus `scripts/coverage/run-coverage.mjs` orchestration that now emits per-theme HTML and `coverage/thematic-summary.json` for CI dashboards.
  - Reaffirmed the CI-only enforcement decision so pre-commit hooks stay fast; coverage status now surfaces through required CI checks that read the thematic summary to flag gaps while developers rely on fast lint/format hooks locally.
  - Reduced global Vitest timeouts to 10 s/15 s/10 s, rebuilt dialog/layout suites with typed observer mocks, and elevated client coverage to 55.49 % statements (≥50 % gate) while keeping responsive/layout tests resilient under the tighter limits.
  - Stabilized the ESLint regression harness by priming caches via warm-up run and expanding the slow-runner timeout to 60 s, resolving Windows flake without concealing genuine lint failures.
  - Validation: `pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure/coverage-validation.test.ts`, `pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure/coverage-thresholds.test.ts`, `pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure/vitest-config-consistency.test.ts tests/eslint/eslint-config.test.ts`, `pnpm --filter @critgenius/client test -- --coverage`, `pnpm test:coverage:summary`, `pnpm -w test`.

### Latest Updates (2025-10-11 – Comprehensive Testing Guide Validation Refresh)

- DOCUMENTATION SUSTAINMENT & VALIDATION (Task 3.1.5 – Comprehensive Testing Guide)
  - Re-ran the 92-test validation suite (`tests/infrastructure/comprehensive-testing-guide.test.ts`) to confirm the comprehensive testing guide retains all required sections, diagrams, realistic TypeScript examples, bash commands, and cross-references demanded by the Continuous Improvement Protocol.
  - Documented the nine-section hierarchy, four sequence diagrams, 50+ D&D-aligned examples, and troubleshooting matrices in the Memory Bank for onboarding alignment; captured sustainment actions to add performance scenarios, expanded E2E coverage, and potential interactive walkthroughs as the test surface grows.
  - Verification: `pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure/comprehensive-testing-guide.test.ts`, `pnpm --filter @critgenius/test-utils test`, `pnpm -w lint`, `pnpm -w type-check`.

### Latest Updates (2025-10-10 – Socket.IO Integration Timeout Stabilization)

- LATENCY BENCHMARK REGRESSION HARNESS HARDENED (Task 3.1.3 Socket.IO Integration Flow)
  - Awaited Socket.IO join acknowledgements, `transcriptionStatus` transitions, and AssemblyAI chunk ingestion inside integration tests to eliminate the 300 s timeout and guarantee deterministic assertions.
  - Promoted `waitForSocketEventWithTimeout` as the canonical typed helper within `@critgenius/test-utils`, removing duplicate exports and `any` escapes while updating documentation and all downstream suites.
  - Guarded orchestration teardown (`httpServer.close()`) to avoid `ERR_SERVER_NOT_RUNNING` noise and froze AssemblyAI mock buffers so assertions operate on stable snapshots; dedicated unit tests lock in the copy semantics.
  - Verification: `pnpm --filter @critgenius/server test`, `pnpm --filter @critgenius/test-utils test`, `pnpm -w lint`, `pnpm -w type-check`.

### Latest Updates (2025-10-08 – Node 18 Path TypeError Diagnostics & Guardrails)

- PATH NORMALIZATION HARDENING (Task 3.1.3 Path TypeError Investigation Enhancement)
  - Reproduced the GitHub Actions URL-based `TypeError` locally by matching Node v18.20.4, confirming CI parity prior to remediation.
  - Added `EnvironmentDetector` and `PathValidator` utilities in `@critgenius/test-utils` to sanitize diagnostics, capture stack traces, and normalize URL/`file://` inputs across Vitest entry points.
  - Updated `vitest.shared.config.ts` and `packages/client/vitest.config.ts` to require string paths, temporarily swap `globalThis.URL` during dynamic imports, and pipe alias resolution through the validator.
  - Authored infrastructure suites (`path-normalization`, `path-validator`, `ci-simulation`) and enabled DEBUG artifact uploads in CI for regression visibility; restored infra checklist item 3.1.4.5 and extended ESLint regression timeout for slow runners.
  - Follow-Ups: Monitor DEBUG artifact noise, evaluate shipping a CLI wrapper for the validator, and track the longer ESLint timeout for further tuning.

### Previous Updates (2025-10-05 – Performance Latency Benchmarking & Regression Detection)

- PERFORMANCE REGRESSION HARNESS HARDENED (Task 3.1.3)
  - Applied the established web encoding polyfill guard inside the shared deterministic test runtime so `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder` invariants hold across client infrastructure suites, eliminating the esbuild-induced failure observed during performance benchmarks.
  - Updated the orchestration service launcher test expectation to pass through environment-provided `PORT` values, aligning the spec with resolver semantics and preventing false negatives when smoke runs inject explicit ports.
  - Treated `startVitest` as a long-lived instance inside `scripts/performance/run-tests.mjs`, awaiting `runningPromise`, invoking `close()`, honoring watch vs. batch modes, and surfacing accurate exit codes (including missing test files) for CI reliability.
  - Verification: `pnpm --filter @critgenius/client test`, `pnpm vitest run tests/orchestration/service-launcher.test.ts`, `node scripts/performance/run-tests.mjs tests/performance/audio-processing.perf.test.ts`, `node scripts/performance/run-tests.mjs non-existent.test.ts`.
  - Follow-Ups: Schedule recurring `pnpm test:performance` CI job once smoke suites stabilize, emit JSON regression summaries for dashboards, and build a watch-mode smoke harness atop the hardened runner.

### Previous Updates (2025-10-02 – Vitest Workspace Hardening & CI Readiness)

- VITEST WORKSPACE HARDENING: Realtime Mock Resilience & Playwright Guard (Task 3.1.1.1)
  - Hoisted AssemblyAI realtime mocks with `vi.hoisted`, added a deterministic reset helper, and guarded close-event callbacks so workspace aggregation no longer dereferences undefined transcribers.
  - Introduced `ensureTextEncoding()` polyfill helper plus Playwright runtime detection, allowing the microphone E2E suite to self-skip under Vitest while dynamically importing `esbuild` when the real Playwright runner is active.
  - Authored `vitest.workspace.ts`, tightened root include/exclude filters, and updated root scripts and infrastructure tests to enforce deterministic project discovery and coverage routing to `coverage/workspace`.
  - Outcomes: `pnpm test`, `pnpm -w lint`, and `pnpm -w type-check` all pass using the unified workspace entry point; Playwright coverage remains intact while Vitest runs stay stable.
  - Follow-Ups: Add dedicated Playwright CI job, consider tagging long-running AssemblyAI resilience cases, and refresh developer workflow docs with the new `pnpm test` semantics.

### Previous Updates (2025-09-30 – Vitest Configuration Standardization)

- VITEST CONFIGURATION STANDARDIZATION: Shared Testing Infrastructure Hardening (Task 3.1.1)
  - Added `loadConfig` helper to infrastructure suite so each `vitest.config.ts` is bundled via `bundleConfigFile` before assertions run, eliminating drift from compiled JavaScript leftovers.
  - Removed the shebang from `scripts/validate-testing-standards.mjs` and exported the validator in a way that supports both CLI execution and Vitest imports, preventing duplicate entry points.
  - Adjusted shared coverage typing and metadata writes in `vitest.shared.config.ts` to match Vitest 3 expectations while preserving coverage thresholds and CSS transformer compatibility under strict TypeScript rules.
  - Outcomes: Infrastructure tests, validator script, and workspace type-check now validate the same TypeScript configuration surface; zero `any` escapes introduced; verification commands (`pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure`, `pnpm validate:testing`, `pnpm -w type-check`) all pass post-refactor.
  - Follow-Ups: Sweep legacy compiled `vitest.config.js` artifacts once downstream tooling stops emitting them; add documentation for the bundling helper and coverage typing nuances to prevent regressions.

- TLS RESILIENCE & TEST AUTOMATION: Secure WebSocket Handshake Coverage (Task 2.10.5)
  - Added `CLIENT_SOCKET_DISABLE_TLS_BYPASS` guard in `socketService`, ensuring self-signed cert bypassing remains opt-in while enabling automated TLS failure simulations.
  - Updated HTTPS integration suites to execute under Vitest’s Node environment, enforcing the Node TLS agent path and validating both successful WSS handshakes and recovery from intentional cert rejections.
  - Hardened shared test setup to guard browser-only APIs when running outside jsdom, preserving stability across mixed-environment suites.
  - Outcomes: HTTPS handshake and TLS resilience scenarios now covered by automated tests; groundwork laid for AssemblyAI HTTPS and audio secure-context validations.
  - Follow-Ups: Extend integration coverage across AssemblyAI streaming endpoints, secure audio context verification, and end-to-end encrypted pipeline tests per task plan.

- Environment Variable Schema and Template System Completed (Task 2.7.1)
  - Comprehensive Zod schema validation with 16 categorized configuration groups
  - Environment-specific templates (.env.development/.staging/.production examples)
  - Centralized environment management & startup validation instrumentation
  - Documentation + environment utility helpers validated across packages

### Previous Updates (2025-08-19)

- Validated real-time integration between Socket.IO and AssemblyAI without a live API key via mocks
- Added unit/integration tests covering control signals, data normalization, error propagation, and
  lifecycle
- Marked infrastructure task 2.6.10 complete and generated a completion report

### Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk:** Strategic foundation complete, clear direction established
- **Low Risk:** Technology stack strategy defined, proven technologies identified
- **Medium Risk:** Real-time performance requirements need architectural validation
- **Mitigation:** Technical architecture phase will address performance and scalability

### Next Session Preparation

- Strategic context fully established and documented
- Ready for system architecture and technical design phase
- Product requirements clearly defined for technical decision-making
- User needs and success criteria established for development guidance
- No memory continuity issues - comprehensive context preserved

## Active Issues

_None - strategic foundation complete, ready for technical planning_

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Remaining Infra Clean-up:** Complete Task 2.1.3 (TypeScript foundation packages) & Task 1.7 (PR/Issue templates)
2. **System Architecture Design:** Define component architecture and data flow patterns
3. **Technical Requirements Analysis:** Validate real-time performance & audio pipeline latency assumptions against AssemblyAI constraints
4. **Benchmark Evolution (Deferred):** Add JSON output + ESLint cache instrumentation (only after infra tasks complete)

## Reference Links

- **Strategic Foundation:** projectbrief.md, productContext.md
- **Next Phase:** systemPatterns.md (for architecture), techContext.md (for implementation)
- **Progress Tracking:** progress.md
- **Source Documentation:** ../context-inputs/product-stratgegy-critgenius-listener.md

## Infrastructure Update

- Environment variable management system completed (schema + templates)
- Client integration layer finalized (sanitized projection, build/test/runtime alignment)
- Socket layer now environment-driven, enabling environment-based endpoint/feature adjustments
- `.env.*.example` templates + new client integration patterns documented
- Validation errors continue to surface early; client build fails fast if projection missing

## Current Focus

- Continue integration testing across client/server/shared
- Refine environment management patterns as needed
