### Latest Updates (2025-09-14)

- **SECURITY / DEV EXPERIENCE:** Local HTTPS Certificate Enablement (Task 2.10.1)
  - ✅ Added development-only HTTPS environment variables (`HTTPS_ENABLED`, `HTTPS_CERT_PATH`, `HTTPS_KEY_PATH`, `HTTPS_PORT`) — isolated from production SSL vars
  - ✅ Implemented idempotent certificate generation script (prefers `mkcert`; OpenSSL fallback with SAN: localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1)

  - ✅ Updated Vite dev server for conditional secure context with graceful HTTP fallback + succinct warning (no hard failure)
  - ✅ Updated docs (`development-server.md`, `environment-configuration-guide.md`) with Local HTTPS section; added schema tests
  - 🔐 Privacy: no secrets or cert material logged; paths only; local CA trust handled by developer machine
  - 📈 Outcome: Enables advanced Web Audio APIs & consistent permission prompts in secure context; positions project for future features needing HTTPS (e.g., screen capture, potential service worker optimizations)
  - 🔜 Follow-Ups: CI guard preventing unintended cert generation, `pnpm dev:https` convenience alias, fallback warning test, decision flow diagram

### Previous Updates (2025-09-03)

- **INFRASTRUCTURE:** Dev Server Validation Extension (Task 2.9.4 – Integration Scaffold)
  - ✅ Added Playwright + programmatic Vite integration test validating `envReloadPlugin` triggers exactly one full reload on `.env` mutation (navigation-based detection)
  - ✅ Introduced dedicated integration test config (`vitest.integration.config.ts`) with serial execution & extended timeouts
  - ✅ Established baseline reload latency metric (~1.2–1.4s) for future regression monitoring
  - ✅ Maintained privacy (no env value logging; structural reload assertion only)
  - 🔜 Follow-Ups: extended watch list test (`ENV_RELOAD_EXTRA`), negative no-reload assertions, WebSocket message capture, latency instrumentation, restart resilience

### Previous Updates (2025-08-31)

- **INFRASTRUCTURE:** Dev Server Validation & Documentation (Task 2.9.4)

 - **RESILIENCE:** Enhanced Health Checks & Intelligent Restart Logic (Task 2.9.3 Resilience Enhancement)
  - ✅ Expanded `/api/health` to structured multi-component response: dependency states (database, cache, externalApi, processing, storage), system metrics (memory), score heuristic (0–100), tri-state status (`healthy|degraded|unhealthy`), per-check detail map.
  - ✅ Implemented mock-first dependency probes (format/presence) for deterministic tests (no network IO); future real pings behind opt-in flag.
  - ✅ Added exponential backoff restart algorithm in orchestration: per-service attempts, capped doubling, circuit breaker after maxAttempts with cooldown.
  - ✅ Per-service restart config blocks (`restart.baseMs|maxMs|maxAttempts|circuitCooldownMs`) added to `services.yaml` enabling differentiated recovery tuning.
  - ✅ Updated tests to allow degraded state; maintained strict type safety under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` via conditional object assembly.
  - ⚠️ Latency metric & event loop lag measurement deferred; CPU load sampling not yet implemented.
  - 🔜 Follow-Ups: extract pure backoff calculator with unit tests, add event loop lag sampling, verbose suppression flag for lightweight probes, memory threshold-based degradation, structured restart logging, multi-probe strategy, parallel independent branch startup, dry-run planning mode.

  - ✅ Implemented pure helper `buildDevProxy` for deterministic proxy map (API + Socket.IO + optional AssemblyAI)
  - ✅ Updated Vite config to conditionally apply proxy (strict optional typing preserved)
