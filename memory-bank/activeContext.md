### Latest Updates (2025-09-30 – Vitest Configuration Standardization)

- VITEST CONFIGURATION STANDARDIZATION: Shared Testing Infrastructure Hardening (Task 3.1.1)
  - Added `loadConfig` helper to infrastructure suite so each `vitest.config.ts` is bundled via `bundleConfigFile` before assertions run, eliminating drift from compiled JavaScript leftovers.
  - Removed the shebang from `scripts/validate-testing-standards.mjs` and exported the validator in a way that supports both CLI execution and Vitest imports, preventing duplicate entry points.
  - Adjusted shared coverage typing and metadata writes in `vitest.shared.config.ts` to match Vitest 3 expectations while preserving coverage thresholds and CSS transformer compatibility under strict TypeScript rules.
  - Outcomes: Infrastructure tests, validator script, and workspace type-check now validate the same TypeScript configuration surface; zero `any` escapes introduced; verification commands (`pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure`, `pnpm validate:testing`, `pnpm -w type-check`) all pass post-refactor.
  - Follow-Ups: Sweep legacy compiled `vitest.config.js` artifacts once downstream tooling stops emitting them; add documentation for the bundling helper and coverage typing nuances to prevent regressions.

### Previous Updates (2025-09-29 – HTTPS Socket.IO Verification)

- TLS RESILIENCE & TEST AUTOMATION: Secure WebSocket Handshake Coverage (Task 2.10.5)
  - Added `CLIENT_SOCKET_DISABLE_TLS_BYPASS` guard in `socketService`, ensuring self-signed cert bypassing remains opt-in while enabling automated TLS failure simulations.
  - Updated HTTPS integration suites to execute under Vitest’s Node environment, enforcing the Node TLS agent path and validating both successful WSS handshakes and recovery from intentional cert rejections.
  - Hardened shared test setup to guard browser-only APIs when running outside jsdom, preserving stability across mixed-environment suites.
  - Outcomes: HTTPS handshake and TLS resilience scenarios now covered by automated tests; groundwork laid for AssemblyAI HTTPS and audio secure-context validations.
  - Follow-Ups: Extend integration coverage across AssemblyAI streaming endpoints, secure audio context verification, and end-to-end encrypted pipeline tests per task plan.

### Previous Updates (2025-09-28 – Audio Diagnostics & Error Codes)

- AUDIO DIAGNOSTICS & ERROR-CODE SEPARATION: Structured Telemetry for Audio Capture (Task 2.10.4.2)
  - Introduced `AudioEventSchema` (Zod) and `StructuredEventReporter` to sanitize and validate capture lifecycle events (retry attempts, guard outcomes, terminal statuses) before emission
  - Reworked the audio capture controller to emit machine-readable `AudioCaptureErrorCode` values independent of UI strings, capturing retry metadata and guard context for observability without leaking sensitive info
  - Added UI helpers (`LocalizedMessages`, `ErrorMessageMapper`) so localized prompts map directly from codes; consolidated Vitest coverage for schema conformance, reporter emissions, retry telemetry, and copy mapping
  - Outcomes: Diagnostics pipeline now produces consistent, privacy-aware telemetry that feeds future monitoring and analytics while simplifying localization
  - Follow-Ups: Integrate mapper into live UI notifications, route structured events to monitoring consumers, and consider promoting the error code taxonomy to `@critgenius/shared`

### Previous Updates (2025-09-28 – Audio Capture Configuration)

- AUDIO CAPTURE CONFIGURATION MODERNIZATION: Unified Audio Capture Configuration (Task 2.10.3)
  - Implemented `createAudioCaptureConfiguration` to centralize guard, reporter, audio context factory, default constraints, feature flags, and retry policy wiring while preserving the legacy `now` alias for backward compatibility
  - Added opt-in diagnostics and latency tracking flags plus configurable retry handling (max attempts + backoff) within the controller `start` workflow
  - Expanded unit tests to validate latency disablement scenarios, retry success, and the standard capture lifecycle using injected mocks for deterministic execution
  - Outcomes: Dependency injection enables per-environment customization, diagnostics toggles avoid code forks, transient microphone failures retried predictably, and future React hook integration gains a stable configuration surface
  - Follow-Ups: Surface the builder inside React capture hooks, add integration coverage asserting diagnostic reporter emissions, and extract retry policy typing into shared utilities if reuse emerges

### Previous Updates (2025-09-25)

- INFRASTRUCTURE / CONFIGURATION: Env Template Generation & Deterministic Loader Precedence (Task 2.10.3)
  - Added schema-driven generators (`generate-env-template.mjs`, `generate-env-overrides.mjs`) producing canonical categorized `.env.example` (managed proxy section) + minimal per-env overrides; both support `--check` drift mode
  - Implemented deterministic non‑mutative dotenv precedence: parse base `.env`, then `.env.{NODE_ENV}`, then overlay existing `process.env`; merged snapshot validated (improves predictability & testability)
  - Added dev flag coercion (interprets literal "true" for designated dev-only booleans) reducing friction while retaining strict production validation
  - Inserted conditional pre-commit drift guard (runs only when schema/templates/scripts touched)
  - Updated docs (`environment-configuration-guide.md`, `pre-commit-workflow.md`), authored task completion report & reflection entry
  - Outcomes: Eliminated schema/template drift, clarified precedence semantics, improved developer ergonomics, preserved privacy (no secret logging)
  - Follow-Ups: CI `generate:env:check` stage, integration test for precedence layering, JSON output mode, ADR documenting rationale & managed section delimitation

### Previous Updates (2025-09-20)

  - Introduced async `buildDevProxyWithDiscovery` with session cache; integrated into Vite `serve` only (build/test unaffected)
  - Tests created for success/disabled/fallback; docs and `.env.example` updated (privacy preserved)
  - Outcome: Faster dev startup with minimal config; bounded discovery time; backward compatible defaults
  - Follow-Ups: Integration test across multiple candidates + HTTPS; optional parallelized probes with cap; dev overlay metrics

- INFRASTRUCTURE / DX: Centralized Proxy Registry (Task 2.10.2-2)
  - Added shared registry for dev proxy routes and env keys: `PROXY_ROUTES`, `PROXY_ENV_KEYS`, `resolveTargetFromEnv`, `getProxyRegistry()`
  - Refactored client proxy builder to iterate registry for HTTP and WS; behavior preserved (AssemblyAI rewrite unchanged)
  - Shared exports added (subpath `./config/proxyRegistry`); unit tests included; lint/type-check/tests PASS
  - Outcome: Eliminates config drift, standardizes protocol/port derivation, enables future docs and .env example generators
  - Follow-Ups: generator scripts + doc test, integration test matrix (HTTPS + candidates), ADR documenting rationale

### Previous Updates (2025-09-17)

  - ✅ Extended tests: proxy config (HTTPS path, allowlist rejection, header emission) + env defaults
  - ✅ Updated docs (`development-proxy.md`) and `.env.example` with secure proxy guidance & failure matrix expansion
  - 🔐 Privacy: no secret or full config logging; sanitized echo only
  - 📈 Outcome: Stronger security posture (least-privilege host routing), reduced handshake overhead via keep-alive, improved developer feedback loop
  - 🔜 Follow-Ups: Full HTTPS + WS integration test (101 assert), latency instrumentation, negative-path tests (timeouts, cert rejection), visual overlay, metrics hook

### Previous Updates (2025-09-14)

- **SECURITY / DEV EXPERIENCE:** Local HTTPS Certificate Enablement (Task 2.10.1)
  - ✅ Added development-only HTTPS environment variables (`HTTPS_ENABLED`, `HTTPS_CERT_PATH`, `HTTPS_KEY_PATH`, `HTTPS_PORT`) — isolated from production SSL vars
  - ✅ Implemented idempotent certificate generation script (prefers `mkcert`; OpenSSL fallback with SAN: localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1)
