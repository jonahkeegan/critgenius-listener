## Testing Infrastructure Patterns

### Testing Infrastructure Pattern: Vitest Configuration Standardization (Task 3.1.1)

- Pattern: Execute canonical TypeScript Vitest configs inside infrastructure tests while sharing a
  single validator entry point across CLI and test environments.
- Implementation: Infrastructure suite bundles each `vitest.config.ts` via `bundleConfigFile` before
  evaluation, the testing standards validator sheds its shebang so it can be imported by Vitest, and
  shared coverage typing is relaxed to match Vitest 3 while metadata writes flow through a typed
  record.
- Benefits: Eliminates stale compiled config drift, ensures validator parity between CLI and tests,
  and keeps strict TypeScript checks green without `any` escapes while preserving coverage and CSS
  transformer guarantees.
- Validation: `pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure`, `pnpm validate:testing`, and
  `pnpm -w type-check` all pass under the new configuration pipeline; memoized bundling keeps suite
  performance stable.

### Testing Infrastructure Pattern: Unified Vitest Workspace Execution (Task 3.1.1.1)

- Pattern: Centralized Vitest workspace orchestrating root infrastructure suites and all package
  projects with deterministic discovery, resilient runtime guards, and shared CLI ergonomics.
- Implementation: `vitest.workspace.ts` enumerates package manifests with local `vitest.config.ts`
  files, injects a root `workspace-infrastructure` project, and sorts project names for stable
  ordering. Root `vitest.config.ts` narrows include/exclude patterns to infrastructure tests only,
  while package manifests continue to rely on shared config factories. Root npm scripts now delegate
  to `vitest --config vitest.workspace.ts`, and coverage aggregation is driven by the CLI flag
  `--coverage.reportsDirectory=coverage/workspace`.
- 2025-10-02 Hardening: AssemblyAI realtime mocks were hoisted via `vi.hoisted` with centralized
  reset helpers to keep workspace runs deterministic; the Playwright microphone E2E suite now
  ensures `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder` availability, dynamically loads `esbuild`, and self-skips
  under Vitest while running fully under the Playwright harness.
- Benefits: Single `pnpm test` executes every workspace project without per-package script drift,
  unified reporters keep output coherent, package onboarding requires no script changes, and
  coverage artifacts consolidate into `coverage/workspace` for downstream tooling. Hoisted mocks
  prevent runtime failures, and runtime guards keep Node-based runners stable without sacrificing
  browser coverage.
- Validation: Infrastructure tests confirm workspace detection, deterministic ordering, and coverage
  script configuration; `pnpm test`, `pnpm -w lint`, and `pnpm -w type-check` exercise the full
  suite post-hardening.

### Testing Infrastructure Pattern: Shared Test Utilities Library (Task 3.1.2)

- Pattern: Workspace-scoped testing toolkit packaging deterministic runtime setup, async utilities,
  Socket.IO mocks, domain factories, fixtures, and Vitest matchers for reuse across packages.
- Implementation: `@critgenius/test-utils` exposes runtime installers that seed fake timers,
  register teardown hooks, polyfill encoders, and provide seeded randomness; helper suites supply
  polling/retry utilities aware of fake timers, Socket.IO mock endpoints, and assertion helpers.
  Domain factories build deterministic users, sessions, transcripts, and audio chunks while custom
  matchers validate transcript structure, speaker labels, latency, and accuracy.
- Integration: Root `tsconfig.json` path aliases and `tests/setup/common-vitest-hooks.ts` now
  reference the package with dynamic fallbacks so consumers can import source prior to build. The
  package ships its own Vitest config, README, and scripts for local development.
- Benefits: Eliminates bespoke helper drift between packages, accelerates scenario authoring with
  shared factories/fixtures, ensures all tests run under the same deterministic runtime, and reduces
  flake by coordinating fake timer advancement.
- Validation: `pnpm --filter @critgenius/test-utils test` exercises package suites (24 tests) and
  `pnpm --filter @critgenius/test-utils build` verifies TypeScript emission.

### Coverage Configuration Single Source Pattern (Task 3.2.1.1)

- Pattern: Centralized coverage metadata module that supplies thresholds, thematic definitions,
  report directories, and execution order helpers to every consumer, preventing drift across
  scripts, configs, and infrastructure tests.
- Implementation: `config/coverage.config.mjs` exports typed objects via `.types.ts`/`.d.ts`
  companions; `scripts/coverage/run-coverage.mjs`, `scripts/coverage/thematic-summary.mjs`, root and
  package `vitest.config.ts`, plus infrastructure suites import the module through
  `pathToFileURL`-safe dynamic imports so both Node and jsdom contexts avoid
  `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME` regressions.
- Benefits: Removes duplicated literals, turns validation suites into true drift detectors, and
  enables deterministic automation—developers can run the documented watchexec loop
  (`~/.cargo/bin/watchexec.exe -c -w config/coverage.config.mjs -w tests/infrastructure/coverage-thresholds.test.ts -- pnpm vitest run …`)
  to receive immediate feedback while CI reads the same metadata for gating.
- Validation:
  `pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure/coverage-thresholds.test.ts tests/infrastructure/coverage-validation.test.ts`
  confirms all packages honor the shared configuration surface.

### Coverage Orchestration Validation Pattern (Task 3.2.2)

- Pattern: Infrastructure-backed coverage orchestration guardrails that assert scripts, execution
  targets, documentation diagrams, and thematic summary generation remain synchronized across the
  workspace.
- Implementation: Added `tests/infrastructure/coverage-orchestration.test.ts` to simulate sequential
  execution, spawn failure propagation, failure aggregation, workspace-only execution semantics, and
  thematic summary refresh behaviour using mocked child processes; hardened
  `scripts/coverage/run-coverage.mjs` to normalize module URLs under jsdom loaders and capture
  orchestrator failure messages in-memory so Vitest assertions stay deterministic without muting
  runtime logs; introduced `scripts/validate-coverage-orchestration.mjs` to verify package scripts,
  documentation headings, coverage config targets, and thematic summary generation with an optional
  `--skip-tests` fast path; refreshed `docs/coverage-system-guide.md` with four sequence diagrams
  covering orchestration workflow, thematic execution order, failure handling, and reporting plus a
  validation toolkit section.
- Benefits: Ensures coverage tooling remains self-documented and drift-free, prevents
  loader-specific regressions from destabilizing orchestration, catches script or documentation
  drift before CI, and provides a single validation entrypoint to confirm the orchestration contract
  (scripts + tests + docs + generator) stays aligned.
- Validation: `pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure/coverage-orchestration.test.ts` and
  `node scripts/validate-coverage-orchestration.mjs` (optionally with `--skip-tests`) confirm the
  orchestration surface is healthy.
- Follow-Ups: Extend the validator to diff `config/coverage.config.mjs` against package manifests,
  wire the validator into CI for automated enforcement, and explore structured JSON diagnostics for
  downstream coverage failure analysis.

### Performance Regression Harness Pattern (Task 3.1.3)

- Pattern: Deterministic performance benchmarking pipeline that reuses shared runtime safeguards,
  mirrors orchestration resolver behavior, and surfaces Vitest lifecycle failures via hardened
  runner semantics.
- Implementation: Integrated the proven web encoding polyfill into the shared deterministic test
  runtime so `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder` invariants hold during client infrastructure suites;
  updated the service launcher spec to accept environment-provided `PORT` values consistent with
  manifest resolution; refactored `scripts/performance/run-tests.mjs` to treat `startVitest` as a
  long-lived instance (awaiting `runningPromise`, calling `close()`, honoring watch vs. batch flows)
  and to propagate exit codes for missing or failing performance suites.
- Benefits: Performance latency benchmarks now execute under real timers without esbuild
  regressions, orchestration smoke tests align with runtime semantics preventing false negatives,
  and CI receives accurate exit behavior enabling reliable regression detection and future
  automation (JSON summaries, watch-mode harness).
- Validation: `pnpm --filter @critgenius/client test`,
  `pnpm vitest run tests/orchestration/service-launcher.test.ts`,
  `node scripts/performance/run-tests.mjs tests/performance/audio-processing.perf.test.ts`, and a
  negative run against a non-existent file confirm success and failure signaling.

### Path Diagnostics & Normalization Guardrail Pattern (Task 3.1.3 Path TypeError Investigation)

- Pattern: Cross-workspace path validation and diagnostics layer that enforces string-only inputs,
  captures environment-aware telemetry, and neutralizes URL-derived Vitest config regressions on
  Node 18.
- Implementation: `EnvironmentDetector` and `PathValidator` in `@critgenius/test-utils` sanitize
  diagnostics, record stack traces when URL inputs appear, and convert URL/`file://` values via
  `fileURLToPath`; `vitest.shared.config.ts` and `packages/client/vitest.config.ts` now route all
  path inputs through the validator while temporarily swapping `globalThis.URL` during dynamic
  imports to guarantee Node 18 semantics.
- Benefits: Eliminates CI-only `TypeError` failures, preserves privacy by masking environment
  context, produces actionable DEBUG artifacts, and keeps alias resolution consistent across
  packages and operating systems.
- Validation: `pnpm -w lint`, `pnpm -w type-check`, focused infrastructure suites
  (`tests/infrastructure/path-normalization.test.ts`, `path-validator.test.ts`,
  `ci-simulation.test.ts`), and CI artifact uploads confirm guardrail effectiveness.

### Documentation Validation Harness Pattern (Task 3.1.5)

- Pattern: Self-validating documentation pipeline ensuring the comprehensive testing guide remains
  accurate, complete, and aligned with Continuous Improvement Protocol requirements.
- Implementation: `docs/comprehensive-testing-guide.md` codifies a nine-section hierarchy
  (philosophy, quick starts, infrastructure deep dive, utilities library, integration handbook,
  performance testing, best practices, troubleshooting, quality gates) enriched with four sequence
  diagrams, 50+ TypeScript D&D-domain examples, 20+ bash commands, and cross-references to five
  supplemental documents. Companion suite `tests/infrastructure/comprehensive-testing-guide.test.ts`
  runs 92 assertions (23 per package) covering structure, diagram counts, code samples, references,
  npm scripts, troubleshooting content, formatting, and completeness.
- Benefits: Guarantees onboarding and expert developers rely on current, high-signal documentation;
  prevents silent drift through automated CI gating; encodes troubleshooting knowledge (symptom →
  resolution) and realistic scenarios so contributors mirror production workflows.
- Validation: `pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure/comprehensive-testing-guide.test.ts` verifies
  structure & references; package-specific runs
  (`pnpm --filter @critgenius/client|server|shared|test-utils test`) ensure helper imports remain
  accurate; lint/type-check gates keep documentation scripts type-safe.

### Integration Testing Harness & Cross-Package Workflow Pattern (Task 3.1.4)

- Pattern: Deterministic integration harness coordinating environment presets, service lifecycles,
  Socket.IO pairs, AssemblyAI mocks, and resilience metrics for workflows spanning client ↔ server
  ↔ shared packages.
- Implementation: `IntegrationTestHarness` applies named presets, restores `process.env`, and wraps
  `ServiceLifecycleManager` which enforces ordered startup/teardown with structured
  `IntegrationServiceError`s; helpers include `allocateAvailablePort`, timeout-aware socket
  listeners, `createMockAssemblyAIScenario`, resilience scenario builders, and environment-aware
  describe/test wrappers that skip suites with contextual reasons.
- Benefits: Integration suites allocate ports dynamically, configure mock-only AssemblyAI flows,
  inject latency/failure modes, and assert transcript/error payloads without bespoke setup.
  Environment gating prevents CI surprises, and documentation/meta-tests codify approved patterns
  for future contributors.
- Validation: `pnpm --filter @critgenius/test-utils test`, `pnpm --filter @critgenius/server test`,
  and `pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure/integration-test-standards.test.ts` verify harness
  integrity, example suites, and documentation coverage.

### Performance Testing Architecture Decision Pattern (Task 3.1.4.5)

- Pattern: Evidence-based architecture evaluation process using pattern analysis, cost-benefit
  matrices, and weighted decision scoring to determine whether proposed refactorings deliver
  meaningful value.
- Decision: DEFER file-based performance result decoupling in favor of maintaining current
  import-based architecture with documentation enhancements (ADR-001).
- Analysis Process: Three-phase evaluation (Pattern Analysis → Cost-Benefit Evaluation →
  Architecture Decision) produced comprehensive documentation (40,000+ characters across 3
  documents) with 248 passing validation tests, quantitative decision matrix scoring (-0.515
  strongly negative), and formal ADR with re-evaluation triggers.
- Implementation: Current architecture uses direct imports where `compare-performance.mjs` and
  `generate-report.mjs` execute `metrics-runner.mjs` for in-memory benchmark results; proposed
  file-based decoupling would require 18 hours implementation + 10-15% ongoing maintenance for zero
  tangible benefits addressing only speculative future scenarios.
- Benefits: Maintains recently stabilized infrastructure (Oct 2025), avoids HIGH regression risk,
  frees 18 hours for higher-value work, preserves 2-minute benchmark execution time, and delivers
  3-hour documentation enhancement with 9:1 value ratio over refactoring.
- Re-evaluation Triggers: Benchmark time exceeds 10 minutes, historical trend analysis becomes
  requirement, multiple runs per cycle become necessary, cross-team sharing emerges, coupling causes
  friction, or implementation cost drops below 5 hours.
- Documentation: `docs/architecture-decisions/adr-001-performance-testing-architecture.md`,
  `docs/performance-architecture-analysis.md` (20K+ chars),
  `docs/performance-architecture-cost-benefit-evaluation.md` (15K+ chars).
- Validation: 248 passing tests (112 for pattern analysis + 136 for cost-benefit evaluation) confirm
  comprehensive evaluation methodology and documentation quality.
