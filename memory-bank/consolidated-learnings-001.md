## TypeScript & Monorepo Architecture

### Pattern: TypeScript Monorepo Configuration

- **Project References:** Configure TypeScript project references carefully between packages in
  monorepo structure for proper build orchestration
- **Parameter Handling:** Use underscore prefix for unused parameters (\_req, \_next) to resolve
  TypeScript errors while maintaining Express.js compatibility
- **Error Handling:** Explicit return statements in Express error handlers are required for
  TypeScript strict mode compliance
- **Build Integration:** Package.json scripts need proper configuration for TypeScript compilation
  across multiple packages
- _Rationale:_ Ensures clean compilation across complex project structures while maintaining type
  safety and Express.js patterns

### Pattern: Vite Build Tool Integration

- **React Integration:** Vite configuration requires careful setup of plugins and dependencies for
  React TypeScript projects
- **Performance:** Vite provides superior development experience compared to Create React App with
  faster builds and modern tooling
- **TypeScript Support:** Native TypeScript support eliminates complex webpack configuration
  overhead
- _Rationale:_ Modern build tooling reduces development friction and improves build performance
  significantly

## Security & Dependency Management

### Pattern: PNPM Security Override Strategy

- **Transitive Dependencies:** Use `pnpm.overrides` configuration in package.json for controlling
  transitive dependency versions during security fixes
- **Vulnerability Resolution:** Apply security patches proactively using version overrides when
  direct updates aren't available
- **Audit Workflow:** Regular `pnpm audit` execution across individual packages provides more
  granular security assessment than workspace-level auditing
- _Rationale:_ Proactive security management prevents vulnerabilities while maintaining dependency
  compatibility

### Pattern: Security Monitoring Process

- **Regular Re-verification:** Periodic security audits validate that previous fixes remain
  effective over time
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Individual package auditing (cd packages/\* && pnpm audit) ensures no
  cross-package vulnerabilities
- **Documentation:** Create completion reports for verification activities to maintain audit trails
  for compliance
- _Rationale:_ Continuous security validation ensures sustained protection against emerging threats

## Testing Framework Architecture

### Pattern: Vitest Over Jest Migration

- **Modern Testing:** Vitest provides better TypeScript integration, faster execution, and native
  ESM support compared to Jest
- **Monorepo Testing:** Establish testing setup with Vitest configs for each package plus
  workspace-level orchestration
- **Environment Isolation:** Proper test setup files prevent cross-contamination between package
  test environments
- **Comprehensive Scripts:** Implement test scripts including `test`, `test:watch`, `test:ui`,
  `test:coverage`, `test:integration`
- _Rationale:_ Modern testing infrastructure reduces setup complexity while improving development
  experience

### Pattern: React Testing Library Integration

- **Component Testing:** Configure @testing-library/react with Vitest for component testing using
  JSDOM environment
- **Async Testing:** Convert test functions to async when handling mocked module imports in complex
  scenarios
- **Cross-Package Testing:** Ensure consistent test environments across client (React/JSDOM), server
  (Node.js), and shared (utility) packages
- _Rationale:_ Standardized testing patterns ensure reliable component validation across different
  environments

## Development Tooling & Quality Gates

### Pattern: ESLint 9 Flat Configuration

- **Modern Configuration:** ESLint 9 flat configuration system is cleaner and more maintainable than
  legacy .eslintrc approach

  via `pnpm prepare`
- **Quality Gates:** Pre-commit hooks with lint-staged prevent code quality issues from entering
  repository
- **Performance:** Modern hook configuration achieves fast linting performance (~4-5 seconds) with
  comprehensive coverage
- _Rationale:_ Automated quality gates ensure consistent code standards without manual intervention

## Git Workflow & Repository Management

### Pattern: Selective File Staging for Monorepos

- **Build Artifact Exclusion:** Be selective about staged files to avoid committing build artifacts
  (.d.ts, .js, .map files)
- **Conventional Commits:** Follow conventional commit format for better change tracking and
  automated tooling integration
- **Pre-commit Validation:** Pre-commit hooks provide comprehensive ESLint and Prettier checks
  across staged files
- _Rationale:_ Disciplined staging practices maintain clean repository history and enable automated
  tooling

### Pattern: GitHub Repository Synchronization

- **Status Checking:** Proper git status checking before adding and committing files ensures clean
  repository state
- **Quality Validation:** All pre-commit hooks must pass before repository synchronization
- **Documentation:** Track commit hashes and file counts for audit trails and change management
- _Rationale:_ Systematic synchronization processes maintain repository integrity and enable
  reliable collaboration

## Context7 MCP Integration

### Pattern: Dependency Verification Workflow

- **Version Validation:** Use Context7 MCP for verifying dependency versions, security status, and
  compatibility requirements
- **Security Assessment:** MCP tools provide valuable validation for selecting stable and secure
  package versions
