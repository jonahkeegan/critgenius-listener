### 2025-09-25 – Task 2.10.3 Environment Template Generation & Deterministic Loader Precedence
Summary: Implemented schema-driven environment template generation and drift guards plus deterministic dotenv precedence. Added `scripts/generate-env-template.mjs` (canonical `.env.example` with categorized groups + managed proxy section) and `scripts/generate-env-overrides.mjs` (minimal per-environment override examples). Both support `--check` mode for CI / pre-commit drift detection. Enhanced `environmentLoader` to perform non‑mutative layered load: parse base `.env`, then `.env.{NODE_ENV}` (if present), then overlay `process.env` values, producing a merged snapshot passed into Zod validation. Introduced development flag coercion (interprets literal "true" for legacy boolean dev-only flags to reduce friction). Added conditional pre-commit hook block running drift checks only when schema, generator scripts, or template files are staged. Updated docs (`environment-configuration-guide.md`, `pre-commit-workflow.md`) and authored task completion report plus reflection entry.

Key Artifacts:
- Generators: `scripts/generate-env-template.mjs`, `scripts/generate-env-overrides.mjs` (both `--check`)
- Loader: `packages/shared/src/config/environmentLoader.ts` (deterministic precedence + dev flag coercion)
- Hooks: `.husky/pre-commit` (conditional env drift block)
- Docs: `docs/environment-configuration-guide.md`, `docs/pre-commit-workflow.md`
- Report: `task-completion-reports/2025-09-23-dev-infra-2-10-3-env-templates-and-drift-guard.md`
- Reflection: `memory-bank/raw_reflection_log.md` (2025-09-25 entry)

Outcomes:
- Single source of truth `.env.example` always synchronized with schema; fast failure on drift
- Deterministic, side-effect contained env loading (easier testing + predictability)
- Reduced developer friction (boolean dev flags auto normalized)
- Privacy preserved (no raw secret logging; managed section inserted deterministically)
- All quality gates green (lint, types, tests, drift checks)

Follow-Ups:
- Add CI pipeline step `pnpm generate:env:check`
- Write integration test covering layered override precedence (base vs NODE_ENV vs real process overrides)
- Optional JSON export mode for generators for future tooling
- Draft ADR capturing precedence rationale & drift guard pattern evolution

Reflection: Captured in task report + raw reflection log; indices updated (progress, system patterns pending pattern insertion).

### 2025-09-21 – Task 2.10.3 Configure HTTPS Dev Protocol & Drift Guard
Summary: Aligned Vite HTTPS/HMR configuration with the centralized proxy registry and instituted drift guards. Refactored `packages/client/vite.config.ts` to use `getProxyRegistry` + `resolveTargetFromEnv`, explicitly configured `server.hmr` to use WSS when HTTPS is enabled, and preserved certificate loading with safe fallbacks. Implemented generators with `--check` to sync `.env.example` and `docs/development-proxy.routes.md` from the registry, and added a validator script to enforce alignment. Wired root scripts and a conditional pre-commit hook to run the validator only when relevant files are staged. All quality gates (format, types, lint, tests, validator) pass.

Key Artifacts:
- Client: `packages/client/vite.config.ts` (registry-driven protocol/port; explicit HMR-over-WSS)
- Generators: `scripts/generate-proxy-env-example.mjs`, `scripts/generate-proxy-docs.mjs` (both support `--check`)
- Validator: `scripts/validate-proxy-drift.mjs` (runs generators in `--check`, asserts registry usage + `server.hmr`)
- Root Scripts: `package.json` (`generate:proxy-env`, `generate:proxy-docs`, `validate:proxy`)
- Pre-commit: `.husky/pre-commit` (conditional validator execution)
- Generated: `docs/development-proxy.routes.md`, managed section in `.env.example`

Outcomes:
- Single source of truth enforced across client/dev scripts and documentation
- Stable HMR over WSS with HTTPS; no mixed-content flakiness
- Deterministic, privacy-safe generators; drift fails fast locally and in CI

Follow-Ups:
- Add `validate:proxy` to CI pipeline after lint/type-check
- Extend preflight script to import registry helpers and assert WS 101 with latency
- Add integration test covering Vite HMR over WSS under HTTPS

### 2025-09-20 – Task 2.10.2-1 Dev Proxy Dynamic Port Discovery
Summary: Implemented dynamic backend port discovery to speed up local startup and reduce configuration friction. Extended shared development env schema with discovery flags and timeouts; added `PortDiscoveryService` to probe localhost candidate ports for `/api/health` with strict per-port and global timeouts and sanitized logging; created async `buildDevProxyWithDiscovery` that caches discovered port for the session and delegates to legacy builder; integrated into Vite `serve` path to await discovery-only in dev. Added unit tests for discovery success/disabled/fallback; updated docs and `.env.example`.

Key Artifacts:
- Shared Env: `packages/shared/src/config/environment.ts` (DEV_PROXY_AUTO_DISCOVER, DEV_PROXY_DISCOVERY_PORTS, DEV_PROXY_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS, DEV_PROXY_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS)
- Client Service: `packages/client/src/config/portDiscovery.ts` (PortDiscoveryService)
- Proxy Builder: `packages/client/src/config/devProxy.ts` (async discovery variant)
- Vite Integration: `packages/client/vite.config.ts` (await discovery in serve)
- Tests: `packages/client/src/__tests__/portDiscovery.test.ts`
- Docs: `docs/development-proxy.md` (Dynamic Discovery), `docs/environment-configuration-guide.md`; `.env.example`

Outcomes:
- Faster, more reliable dev startup with minimal manual config
- Bounded discovery time (global + per-port timeouts), localhost-only safety
- Privacy-preserving logs (no secrets; sanitized summaries)
- Backward compatibility preserved; production/build flows unchanged

Follow-Ups:
- Add integration test spanning multiple candidates and HTTPS
- Optional dev overlay with discovery metrics; parallel probe fan-out with cap

### 2025-09-20 – Task 2.10.2-2 Centralized Proxy Registry
Summary: Introduced a single source of truth for development proxy routes and environment keys in shared, and refactored the client proxy builder to consume it. Preserves existing behavior while enabling future generators for documentation and `.env` examples. Strengthens maintainability, reduces config drift, and standardizes protocol/port resolution.

Key Artifacts:
- Shared: `packages/shared/src/config/proxyRegistry.ts` (PROXY_ROUTES, PROXY_ENV_KEYS, `resolveTargetFromEnv`, `getProxyRegistry()`)
- Shared Tests: `packages/shared/src/config/proxyRegistry.test.ts`
- Shared Exports: `packages/shared/src/index.ts` (export), `packages/shared/package.json` (subpath export `./config/proxyRegistry`)
- Client: `packages/client/src/config/devProxy.ts` (refactor to iterate registry for HTTP + WS; preserves AssemblyAI rewrite behavior)

Outcomes:
- Maintainability: centralized routes/keys eliminate duplication across packages
- Consistency: helper unifies protocol/port derivation; fewer edge cases in consumers
- Safety: no secrets logged; registry facilitates sanitized summaries
- Quality Gates: lint/type-check/tests PASS across shared, client, and root

Deferred Follow-Ups:
- Generators: `scripts/generate-proxy-docs.mjs` → `docs/development-proxy.routes.md`; `scripts/generate-proxy-env-example.mjs` → update `.env.example` selectively; add minimal doc test
- Integration test matrix across multiple candidate ports and HTTPS
- Dev overlay with discovery metrics and bounded fan-out probing
- ADR summarizing the centralized proxy registry decision and rationale

Reflection & Knowledge Capture:
- Recorded in `raw_reflection_log.md`; indices and context updated (progress, tech context, system patterns)

### 2025-09-17 – Task 2.10.2 Dev HTTPS Proxy Hardening & Secure Diagnostics
Summary: Extended local secure context work (Task 2.10.1) to harden and expand the development proxy with optional HTTPS upstream targeting and security-focused controls. Added new dev-only environment variables enabling protocol selection (`DEV_PROXY_HTTPS_ENABLED`), distinct secure port targeting (`DEV_PROXY_TARGET_HTTPS_PORT`), certificate trust relaxation toggle (`DEV_PROXY_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`), and explicit host allow‑list enforcement (`DEV_PROXY_ALLOWED_HOSTS`). Refactored pure `buildDevProxy` helper to:
 - Auto-select http/https agents with keep-alive for lower handshake overhead
 - Inject `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to preserve original scheme semantics
 - Enforce host allowlist early (fail fast with descriptive error) preventing accidental proxy to unapproved hosts
 - Respect rejection toggle for self-signed cert experimentation while defaulting to safe verification
 - Preserve AssemblyAI passthrough disablement unless explicitly re-enabled in future hardened path
Introduced preflight diagnostics script (`scripts/dev-https-preflight.mjs`) performing summarized configuration echo (sanitized), HTTP health probe, and WebSocket upgrade heuristic to surface misconfiguration (e.g., mixed protocol, cert trust failure) before interactive development.

Key Artifacts:
- Updated Env Schema: `packages/shared/src/config/environment.ts` (new dev proxy HTTPS vars)
- Updated Proxy Builder: `packages/client/src/config/devProxy.ts`
- Tests: `packages/client/src/__tests__/viteProxy.config.test.ts` (HTTPS branch, allowlist rejection, header emission); `packages/shared/src/config/environment.https.test.ts` (defaults & enabled scenario)
- Script: `scripts/dev-https-preflight.mjs` (diagnostics)
- Docs: `docs/development-proxy.md` (HTTPS section, failure matrix expansion) & `docs/development-server.md` (table normalization fix) + `.env.example` template addition
- Reflection: Captured in `raw_reflection_log.md`; memory indices pending update (this commit)

Outcomes:
- Strengthened security posture (least privilege host routing, explicit protocol selection)
- Reduced latency potential via keep-alive agent reuse
- Improved developer feedback loop (preflight exposes misconfig before manual browser discovery)
- Maintained backward compatibility (defaults keep HTTP behavior if HTTPS not enabled)
- Preserved privacy (no secrets logged; sanitized config echo only)

Deferred Follow-Ups:
- Full integration test with mock HTTPS upstream + real WebSocket 101 assertion
- Preflight enhancement: measure and report handshake + health latency; explicit WS 101 status capture
- Negative-path tests (timeout, cert rejection path, mixed protocol misconfig)
- Visual dev overlay summarizing active proxy + security flags
- Metrics hook for proxy request/latency instrumentation

Reflection & Knowledge Capture:
- Documented allowlist rationale: prevents accidental tunneling to unintended localhost services
- Established pattern for progressive tightening (start permissive with explicit toggles → default secure stance once stabilized)
- Captured test strategy separation (pure proxy map vs. future integration layer) to keep feedback loop fast

### 2025-09-14 – Task 2.10.1 Local HTTPS Certificate Enablement
Summary: Implemented optional secure local development context to satisfy browser requirements for advanced Web Audio & upcoming permission consistency features. Added development-focused HTTPS environment variables (`HTTPS_ENABLED`, `HTTPS_CERT_PATH`, `HTTPS_KEY_PATH`, `HTTPS_PORT`) without impacting production SSL config. Created idempotent certificate generation script favoring `mkcert` (with automatic local CA install) and falling back to OpenSSL self-signed generation (subjectAltName: localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1). Added expiration check script with warning threshold. Updated Vite dev server to conditionally serve over HTTPS when env + cert files present with graceful fallback (clear console warning) to preserve developer flow. Ensured privacy: certificates ignored via `.gitignore`; no secret logging; sanitized path logging only.

Key Artifacts:
- New Scripts: `scripts/setup-https-certs.mjs`, `scripts/check-cert-expiration.mjs`
- Updated Schema: `packages/shared/src/config/environment.ts` (development HTTPS vars)
- Updated Dev Server: `packages/client/vite.config.ts` (conditional https block)
- Env Templates: `.env.example`, `.env.development.example`
- Docs: `docs/development-server.md` (Local HTTPS section), `docs/environment-configuration-guide.md`
- Tests: `packages/shared/src/config/environment.https.test.ts`

Outcomes:
- Secure context available locally enabling future features (e.g., advanced audio processing, potential clipboard / screen share integrations)
- Deterministic, script-driven certificate lifecycle (idempotent unless `--force`)
- Reduced friction via graceful HTTP fallback when disabled or missing assets
- Clear operational visibility (expiration check + concise console messaging)

Deferred Follow-Ups:
- Add CI guard to ensure cert scripts not invoked in CI (prevent unintended CA trust ops)
- Optional dev command alias `pnpm dev:https` for explicit secure start
- Add test for fallback warning path (missing cert files)
- Add documentation diagram for HTTPS decision flow (enable → files exist → serve secure else warn)

Reflection & Knowledge Capture:
- Recorded in `raw_reflection_log.md` & integrated into memory bank indices (progress, tech context, system patterns security patterns)


### 2025-08-31 – Task 2.9.4 Dev Server Validation & Documentation
Summary: Migrated from planned standalone validation script to fully test-centric approach. Extracted `envReloadPlugin` to dedicated module for isolation; added unit test validating full-reload trigger on watched file mutation; implemented minimal HTTP proxy forwarding integration test (Express + manual proxy) supplanting heavier Vite+Socket.IO attempt; introduced simulated react-refresh HMR state retention harness (permissive assertion due to jsdom/runtime limitations); updated `docs/development-server.md` with validation workflow & troubleshooting; removed obsolete skipped test; enforced zero lint warnings & strict type safety (added `@types/react-refresh`).

Key Artifacts:
- New: `packages/client/src/dev/envReloadPlugin.ts`
- Tests: `env-reload.plugin.test.ts`, `proxy-forwarding.integration.test.ts`, `refresh-state-retention.test.ts`
- Doc Update: `docs/development-server.md`

Outcomes:
- Deterministic plugin reload validation
- Fast, reliable proxy forwarding verification
- Early HMR state retention signal (simulated) without full dev server
- Reduced integration flakiness & eliminated global test hook hacks

Deferred Follow-Ups:
- WebSocket proxy forwarding test (socket.io)
- Real Vite-driven strict HMR state preservation suite
- Negative path / error propagation proxy tests
- Watcher disposal assertion & reload latency instrumentation

### 2025-09-03 – Task 2.9.4 Extension: envReloadPlugin Integration Test Scaffold
Summary: Introduced first end-to-end integration test validating `envReloadPlugin` triggers browser full reload on `.env` change using programmatic Vite server + Playwright (Chromium). Test asserts exactly one navigation reload within 2s and establishes reusable pattern for future scenarios.

Key Artifacts:
- New: `packages/client/vitest.integration.config.ts` (integration tier config)
- Test: `packages/client/src/__tests__/integration/env-reload-plugin.integration.test.ts`
- Updated: `packages/client/package.json` (Playwright dev dependencies)
- Updated: `packages/client/tsconfig.json` (added Playwright types)

Outcomes:
- Confirmed end-to-end reload path (file change → plugin ws message → Vite client reload → navigation)
- Established baseline reload latency (~1.2–1.4s cold start)
- Avoided over-coupling to internal WS protocol initially (navigation proxy suffices)
- Maintained privacy (no env value logging)

Deferred Follow-Ups (Scaffold Roadmap):
- ENV_RELOAD_EXTRA scenario
- Negative test (non-env file should not reload)
- Batched rapid edits (debounce / single reload guarantee)
- Direct WebSocket message capture + shape assertion
- Reload latency metric & threshold alerting
- Server restart resilience test
- Log assertion (remove silent log level / structured logger)

### 2025-09-06 – Task 2.9.4 Enhancement: envReloadPlugin Interface + Dedup + Docs
Summary: Extended `envReloadPlugin` with explicit `extraWatchPaths?: string[]` option while preserving backward compatibility with `ENV_RELOAD_EXTRA`. Implemented path canonicalization and Map-based deduplication to ensure single watcher per file across sources and robust change detection on Windows. Updated `packages/client/vite.config.ts` to show explicit config; expanded unit tests to cover option handling, env fallback, merging, and normalization. Gated Playwright-based integration test remains opt-in; docs updated to reflect explicit configuration and opt-in integration.

Key Artifacts:
- Updated: `packages/client/src/dev/envReloadPlugin.ts` (options + canonicalization + dedup)
- Updated: `packages/client/vite.config.ts` (explicit plugin configuration)
- Tests: `packages/client/src/__tests__/dev-server/env-reload.plugin.test.ts` (options/env merge & dedup)
- Docs: `docs/development-server.md` (usage and integration flag)
- Knowledge: `memory-bank/consolidated-learnings-006.md` updated; `raw_reflection_log.md` reset to template-only

Outcomes:
- Discoverable, type-safe configuration with zero breaking changes
- Reliable watch behavior across platforms (case-insensitive paths on Windows)
- Default CI remains green with integration test gated by `RUN_CLIENT_IT=true`
- Privacy posture preserved (no secret logging; relative file paths only)

Follow-Ups:
- Add a focused unit test asserting dedup when a path appears in both `extraWatchPaths` and `ENV_RELOAD_EXTRA`
- Add docs example for `extraVarName` override
