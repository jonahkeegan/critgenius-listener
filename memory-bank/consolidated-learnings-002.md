## System Notes
This file contains consolidated learnings from Socket.IO server implementation for real-time communication capabilities in the CritGenius Listener application.

## Maintenance Schedule
Next review scheduled after completion of client-side Socket.IO integration (Task 2.6.3).

## Real-Time Communication & WebSocket Integration
**Pattern: Socket.IO Integration with Express using HTTP Server Wrapper**
- For real-time communication, integrate Socket.IO with Express using HTTP server wrapper pattern to maintain single port usage
- Implement proper CORS configuration matching existing Express CORS settings for seamless client integration
- Add connection state recovery with 2-minute disconnection tolerance for improved reliability
- *Rationale:* HTTP server wrapper pattern integrates Socket.IO seamlessly with Express without port conflicts. Connection state recovery provides better user experience during temporary network issues.

**Pattern: Real-Time Communication Event Architecture with TypeScript Type Safety**
- Create comprehensive TypeScript event interface definitions for type-safe real-time communication
- Implement structured event handling for session lifecycle management (join, leave, start, stop)
- Include comprehensive logging for connection lifecycle events (connect, disconnect, errors)
- *Rationale:* TypeScript type safety ensures robust communication between client and server. Structured event handling provides clear session management patterns.

**Pattern: Session-Based Room Management for Isolated Communication Channels**
- Use Socket.IO room-based session management to enable isolated communication channels for different audio sessions
- Implement session joining and leaving with proper logging and status updates
- Broadcast session events to room participants for real-time collaboration
- *Rationale:* Room-based management enables multiple concurrent sessions with proper isolation. Broadcasting ensures all participants receive real-time updates.

**Pattern: Structured Error Handling and Logging for WebSocket Communication**
- Implement proper error handling with structured error events sent to clients
- Add comprehensive logging for all WebSocket communication flows
- Handle connection errors, timeouts, and disconnection scenarios gracefully
- *Rationale:* Structured error handling provides better debugging and user experience. Comprehensive logging enables effective monitoring and troubleshooting.
