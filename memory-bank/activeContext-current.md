## Latest Updates

### 2025-10-16 – Memory Bank Refactoring

- **ACTIVE CONTEXT SEGMENTATION**: Refactored monolithic activeContext.md (483 rows) into hybrid
  structure
  - Created `index-activeContext.md` with registry and maintenance protocol
  - Extracted current state to `activeContext-current.md` (~150 rows)
  - Archived historical updates to `activeContext-history-001.md` (~330 rows)
  - Preserved original as `activeContext-legacy-2025-10-16.md`
  - Follows established memory bank pattern from systemPatterns, techContext, progress refactorings

### 2025-10-16 – CI Coverage Integration & Codecov Reporting (Task 3.2.3)

- Extended `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to execute thematic coverage sweep, upload HTML/JSON
  artifacts, and report to Codecov v5
- Strengthened infrastructure safeguards with CI coverage integration and Windows reserved names
  tests
- Updated contributor documentation with Codecov badge and runbook
- Published `docs/memory-bank-raw-reflection-log-best-practices.md` to standardize reflection
  hygiene

### 2025-10-15 – Coverage Gate Recalibration (Task 3.2.2.1)

- Synchronized infrastructure tests with 9% workspace threshold defined in
  `config/coverage.config.mjs`
- Re-validated thematic coverage suite under relaxed gate
- Confirmed consistency harness stays in sync with shared configuration module

### 2025-10-13 – Coverage Orchestration Validation (Task 3.2.2)
