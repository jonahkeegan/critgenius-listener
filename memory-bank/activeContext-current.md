## Latest Updates

### 2025-10-29 – Cross-Browser E2E Smoke Tests (Task 3.5.3)

- Hardened the transcription smoke test by shifting from console parsing to a structured
  `window.__critgeniusSocketEvents` buffer populated in `SocketService.emitTestEvent`, keeping the
  instrumentation behind `VITE_E2E` so production behaviour remains unchanged while Playwright gets
  deterministic payload access.
- Cleared the event queue before each emission, reused listener readiness checks to avoid timing
  races, and reran the full six-project matrix to confirm Firefox now passes with Chromium, Edge,
  and WebKit.

### 2025-10-28 – Playwright Browser Matrix & Runtime Config Guard (Task 3.5.2)

- Expanded `packages/client/playwright.config.ts` to cover six browser/viewport combinations with
  deterministic `test-results`/`playwright-report` directories, shared fake media flags, and
  retained screenshots/videos/traces on failure, ensuring responsive coverage remains reproducible.
- Introduced `packages/client/tests/e2e/helpers/config-validator.ts` and wired it through the
  microphone access smoke test via Playwright worker fixtures so `workerInfo.config` reporters,
  directories, and project metadata are validated before the HTTPS harness boots, resolving the
  earlier TypeScript config import failure.
- Updated the root `test:e2e:report` script to delegate `playwright show-report` from the client
  package and refreshed `docs/developer-onboarding.md` plus `docs/comprehensive-testing-guide.md`
  with viewport matrix tables, watchexec loops, and report inspection guidance.

### 2025-10-27 – Playwright Workspace Orchestration (Task 3.5.1)

- Centralized Playwright dependencies in the root workspace and added `test:e2e`, `test:e2e:headed`,
  `test:e2e:install`, and `test:e2e:report` scripts, delegating `test:e2e:ui` to the client’s new
  `test:browser:ui` command to keep interactive runs in the correct package context.
- Updated `docs/developer-onboarding.md` and `docs/comprehensive-testing-guide.md` with install,
  headless/headed execution, UI runner usage, and report review instructions so contributors can
  rely on root scripts without rediscovering workflow details.
- Validation coverage confirmed via `pnpm run test:e2e:install`, `pnpm run test:e2e`,
  `pnpm run test:e2e:headed`, `pnpm --filter @critgenius/client exec -- playwright test --list`, and
  `pnpm run test:e2e:ui` (manual exit after verifying suite visibility).

### 2025-10-27 – EditorConfig Alignment with Prettier (Task 3.4.2)

- Added a root-level `.editorconfig` matching `prettier.config.js` defaults for indentation, line
  endings, trailing whitespace trimming, Markdown double-space preservation, and lockfile newline
  handling so contributors using WebStorm, Sublime, Vim, or other editors stay aligned with repo
  formatting.
- Expanded `docs/developer-onboarding.md` with EditorConfig plugin requirements, quick validation
  steps, alignment checklist, and troubleshooting tips to reduce onboarding friction for non-VS-Code
  users.
- Documented reviewer guidance to rerun the alignment checklist whenever Prettier defaults change,
  keeping EditorConfig and Prettier synchronized over time.

### 2025-10-26 – VSCode Prettier Format-on-Save Configuration (Task 3.4.1)

- Created `.vscode/settings.json` to default Prettier across
  TypeScript/JavaScript/JSON/Markdown/YAML, enable format-on-save, keep ESLint fixes explicit, and
  standardize LF newlines with trailing whitespace trimming.
- Added `.vscode/extensions.json` recommending Prettier, ESLint, and TypeScript Nightly extensions
  so VS Code prompts developers to install required tooling whenever the repo opens.
- Updated `.gitignore` to track workspace configs and expanded `docs/developer-onboarding.md` with a
  VS Code setup checklist, manual format-on-save validation steps, troubleshooting, and alternative
  editor notes.

### 2025-10-25 – CI ESLint Documentation (Task 3.3.5)

- Authored `docs/eslint-guide.md` to centralize lint workflows, configuration rationale, six Mermaid
  diagrams, and troubleshooting matrices so developers can resolve lint issues quickly.
- Linked the guide from `docs/developer-onboarding.md`, ensuring new contributors encounter lint
  expectations early during onboarding.
- Captured future follow-ups around documentation validation automation and onboarding escalation
  guidance in the Memory Bank reflection entry.

### 2025-10-23 – CI ESLint Workflow Guard (Task 3.3.4)

- Authored `tests/infrastructure/ci-eslint-integration.test.ts` to guarantee the CI workflow boots
  dependencies before lint execution, enforces zero-warning exits, and preserves accessibility rule
  coverage.
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `scripts/lint-ci.mjs` to align with those guardrails so
  lint gating stays post-bootstrap and regressions surface immediately through infrastructure
  suites.
- Documented the guard expectations and troubleshooting playbook in `docs/ci-eslint-integration.md`
  while marking task completion inside `tasks/infrastructure-setup-task-list.md`.

### 2025-10-19 – ESLint Validation Infrastructure Expansion (Task 3.3.2)

- Curated targeted lint fixtures and staged them into disposable `__eslint-fixtures__` directories
  per package during `tests/infrastructure/eslint-audit-validation.test.ts` executions, broadening
  severity and override coverage without polluting tracked paths.
- Hardened the validation suite with fixture inventory checks, severity matrix assertions,
  React/server/test glob override verification, and a clean baseline guard before tearing down
  staged directories.
- Updated `docs/eslint-scripts.md` to explain the harness workflow and accessibility posture,
  keeping onboarding guidance aligned with the automation.

### 2025-10-17 – ESLint Configuration Audit & Accessibility Policy (Task 3.3.1)

- Consolidated the ESLint flat config as the single source of truth by deleting `eslint.config.cjs`,
  tightening ignores to generated output, and adding Node globals so scripts lint cleanly.
- Authored `tests/infrastructure/eslint-audit-validation.test.ts` covering plugin coverage,
  per-package lint scripts, JSX a11y posture, and lint CI enforcement, then reran `pnpm run lint:ci`
  plus workspace type checks to confirm zero warnings.
- Published `docs/audio-ui-accessibility-policy.md` to document the audio-first WCAG 2.1 AA stance,
  keyboard requirements, and rationale for keeping `jsx-a11y/media-has-caption` disabled until video
  capture ships.

## Decision Log

- **2025-10-29:** Ratified Playwright socket event buffer instrumentation as the standard for
  transcript assertions, eliminating cross-browser console parsing and ensuring deterministic data
  capture behind the `VITE_E2E` gate.
- **2025-10-28:** Ratified Playwright responsive browser matrix and runtime config validator as the
  baseline for E2E coverage, ensuring six-project regression coverage with deterministic artifacts
  and fast-fail safeguards ahead of harness initialization.
- **2025-10-27:** Adopted root-level Playwright orchestration pattern with delegated UI runner to
  the client package to keep workspace scripts consistent while preserving package-scoped
  configuration.
- **2025-10-27:** Ratified EditorConfig ↔ Prettier alignment as a mandatory cross-editor baseline
  with documented reviewer checklist to maintain parity as formatting defaults evolve.
- **2025-10-26:** Ratified VS Code workspace Prettier enforcement so save-on-format behaviour stays
  consistent across contributors and onboarding includes validation guidance.
- **2025-10-23:** Ratified CI lint workflow guard as mandatory (infrastructure test + aligned
  scripts + contributor documentation) to ensure zero-warning enforcement and accessibility
  coverage.
- **2025-10-17:** Ratified flat ESLint config as single authoritative source and adopted the audio
  UI accessibility policy to document `media-has-caption` stance until video support ships.
- **2025-10-16:** Adopted hybrid segmentation for activeContext.md (current + history archive)
- **2025-08-25:** ADR-006 accepted (Lightweight pre-commit automation strategy)
