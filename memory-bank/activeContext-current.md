## Latest Updates

### 2025-10-19 – ESLint Validation Infrastructure Expansion (Task 3.3.2)

- Curated targeted lint fixtures and staged them into disposable `__eslint-fixtures__` directories
  per package during `tests/infrastructure/eslint-audit-validation.test.ts` executions, broadening
  severity and override coverage without polluting tracked paths.
- Hardened the validation suite with fixture inventory checks, severity matrix assertions,
  React/server/test glob override verification, and a clean baseline guard before tearing down
  staged directories.
- Updated `docs/eslint-scripts.md` to explain the harness workflow and accessibility posture,
  keeping onboarding guidance aligned with the automation.

### 2025-10-17 – ESLint Configuration Audit & Accessibility Policy (Task 3.3.1)

- Consolidated the ESLint flat config as the single source of truth by deleting `eslint.config.cjs`,
  tightening ignores to generated output, and adding Node globals so scripts lint cleanly.
- Authored `tests/infrastructure/eslint-audit-validation.test.ts` covering plugin coverage,
  per-package lint scripts, JSX a11y posture, and lint CI enforcement, then reran `pnpm run lint:ci`
  plus workspace type checks to confirm zero warnings.
- Published `docs/audio-ui-accessibility-policy.md` to document the audio-first WCAG 2.1 AA stance,
  keyboard requirements, and rationale for keeping `jsx-a11y/media-has-caption` disabled until video
  capture ships.

### 2025-10-16 – Memory Bank Refactoring

- **ACTIVE CONTEXT SEGMENTATION**: Refactored monolithic activeContext.md (483 rows) into hybrid
  structure
  - Created `index-activeContext.md` with registry and maintenance protocol
  - Extracted current state to `activeContext-current.md` (~150 rows)
  - Archived historical updates to `activeContext-history-001.md` (~330 rows)
  - Preserved original as `activeContext-legacy-2025-10-16.md`
  - Follows established memory bank pattern from systemPatterns, techContext, progress refactorings

### 2025-10-16 – CI Coverage Integration & Codecov Reporting (Task 3.2.3)

- Extended `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to execute thematic coverage sweep, upload HTML/JSON
  artifacts, and report to Codecov v5
- Strengthened infrastructure safeguards with CI coverage integration and Windows reserved names
  tests
- Updated contributor documentation with Codecov badge and runbook
- Published `docs/memory-bank-raw-reflection-log-best-practices.md` to standardize reflection
  hygiene

### 2025-10-15 – Coverage Gate Recalibration (Task 3.2.2.1)

- Synchronized infrastructure tests with 9% workspace threshold defined in
  `config/coverage.config.mjs`
- Re-validated thematic coverage suite under relaxed gate
- Confirmed consistency harness stays in sync with shared configuration module

### 2025-10-13 – Coverage Orchestration Validation (Task 3.2.2)

- Authored `tests/infrastructure/coverage-orchestration.test.ts` for sequential execution validation
- Published `scripts/validate-coverage-orchestration.mjs` for contributor drift checks
- Expanded `docs/coverage-system-guide.md` with four new sequence diagrams
- Memory Bank Segment 005 promoted to version 1.2.0

### 2025-10-13 – Testing Infrastructure Segmentation

- Established new `systemPatterns-005.md` for testing infrastructure patterns
- Updated `systemPatterns-index.md` (version 1.18.0) with new registry
- Revised Segment 003 metadata (version 1.16.0) for runtime focus

### 2025-10-13 – Centralized Coverage Configuration (Task 3.2.1.1)

- Introduced `config/coverage.config.mjs` as authoritative source for thresholds
- Refactored coverage scripts and Vitest configs to import shared module
- Hardened infrastructure drift detection via shared module assertions

## Decision Log

- **2025-10-17:** Ratified flat ESLint config as single authoritative source and adopted the audio
  UI accessibility policy to document `media-has-caption` stance until video support ships.
- **2025-10-16:** Adopted hybrid segmentation for activeContext.md (current + history archive)
- **2025-08-25:** ADR-006 accepted (Lightweight pre-commit automation strategy)
- **2025-08-24:** ADR-005 accepted (Client-safe environment projection)

## Active Issues

_None - strategic foundation complete, ready for technical planning_

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Remaining Infra Clean-up:** Complete Task 2.1.3 (TypeScript foundation packages) & Task 1.7
   (PR/Issue templates)
2. **System Architecture Design:** Define component architecture and data flow patterns
3. **Technical Requirements Analysis:** Validate real-time performance & audio pipeline latency
   assumptions
4. **Benchmark Evolution (Deferred):** Add JSON output + ESLint cache instrumentation (after infra
   tasks complete)

## Infrastructure Update

- Environment variable management system completed (schema + templates)
- Client integration layer finalized (sanitized projection, build/test/runtime alignment)
- Socket layer now environment-driven, enabling environment-based endpoint/feature adjustments
- `.env.*.example` templates + new client integration patterns documented

- Refine environment management patterns as needed
- Complete remaining infrastructure tasks before feature development
