# Raw Reflection Log - CritGenius: Listener

**Purpose:** Initial detailed capture of task reflections, learnings, difficulties, and successes. Raw entries here are candidates for later consolidation into consolidated-learnings files.

**Usage:** Add timestamped, task-referenced entries after completing tasks or gaining significant insights. Keep entries detailed and comprehensive - pruning happens during consolidation.

**Structure:** Each entry should include:
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- TaskRef (descriptive task reference)
- Learnings (key discoveries and insights)
- Technical Discoveries (specific technical findings)
- Success Patterns (what worked well)
- Implementation Excellence (noteworthy implementation details)
- Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation (patterns ready for consolidation)

TaskRef: "Task 2.8.4: Integrate enhanced Husky pre-commit scripts (conditional TS type-check + validation tooling)"

Learnings:
- Conditional execution (detecting staged TS/TSX) preserves performance while raising baseline quality—most non-code commits now skip the heavier step automatically.
- Developer feedback clarity (emoji status + timing) meaningfully reduces cognitive load scanning hook output; small UI touches matter in infra ergonomics.
- A simulation harness (`precommit-simulate`) provides higher assurance than ad-hoc manual staging, and is low-maintenance when built on top of existing hook logic.
- Formatting “errors” are often auto-fixable; tests must treat those scenarios differently than true lint/type failures to avoid false negatives.

Technical Discoveries:
- Using `git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM` is sufficient for staged file detection; no need to consider deletions for type-check gating (deleted files can’t introduce new type regressions directly).
- Timing the type-check gives a baseline for future regression monitoring without adding external dependencies.
- `pnpm -w type-check` already leverages per-package isolation; no extra scripts required for incremental builds yet.
- Simulation needed to unstage temporary files—safe cleanup via `git reset HEAD .` keeps working tree integrity.

Success Patterns:
- Reuse of existing lint-staged config avoided config drift; enhancement focused purely on orchestration layer (hook script).
- Documentation update immediately after implementation ensures knowledge capture while fresh.
- Scenario-based validation encourages proactive failure-mode thinking (lint, format, type) and accelerates future refactors.

Implementation Excellence:
- Hook written with portable POSIX shell subset for cross-platform reliability; avoided Bash-only constructs.
- Graceful skip path with explicit message reduces confusion (“did it run?”) for non-TS commits.
- Scripts isolated (`precommit-validate`, `precommit-simulate`) to separate concerns: performance benchmarking vs. failure-mode simulation.
- No leakage of environment or secret values; output limited to status lines.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Add CI job to run simulation suite to detect regressions in hook semantics.
- Introduce optional JSON output mode for the simulator for machine parsing and dashboarding.
- Explore caching `.tsbuildinfo` artifacts for further type-check speedup once scale increases.
- Potential future selective test execution (detect changed packages) as an optional pre-push gate.

TaskRef: "Task 2.8.1: Install Husky and lint-staged for pre-commit automation"

Learnings:
- Maintaining lightweight hooks (ESLint + Prettier only) preserves developer velocity while still preventing nearly all formatting/lint CI failures.
- Adding shebangs to Husky scripts avoids shell resolution issues across Windows (Git Bash) and Unix.
- Centralizing lint-staged config in root `package.json` keeps monorepo maintenance simpler than per-package configs, given consistent tooling.

Technical Discoveries:
- Existing dependencies already satisfied requirements; focus shifted to hardening scripts and documentation instead of re-installation.
- Conventional Commit enforcement via `commit-msg` hook provides early feedback and reduces PR churn.
- stderr redirection in the commit message hook improves clarity inside some Git clients that suppress stdout on failure.

Success Patterns:
- Documentation (`docs/pre-commit-workflow.md`) accelerates contributor onboarding and clarifies extension points (type-check/tests optional).
- Explicit skip guidance (`--no-verify`) reduces temptation for ad-hoc hook edits.
- Completion report template streamlines traceability for infra tasks.

Implementation Excellence:
- Added descriptive comments in hooks for future maintainers.
- Ensured patterns align with Memory Bank quality gate expectations (fast, deterministic, privacy-aware—no secret logging).
- Hook changes avoided introducing runtime dependencies or altering existing build/test flows.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Introduce optional run-once type-check via JS-based lint-staged config when codebase size grows.
- Add secret scanning (git-secrets or trufflehog-lite) as a future lightweight hook.
- Potential selective test invocation for touched packages using `--filter` logic.
