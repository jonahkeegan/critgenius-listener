## Raw Reflection Log - CritGenius: Listener

**Purpose:** Capture fresh, detailed reflections (tasks, learnings, discoveries, successes) prior to consolidation. This file is periodically distilled into `consolidated-learnings-XXX.md` entries per Continuous Improvement Protocol.

TaskRef: "Dev Infra 3.2.3 – CI/CD Coverage Integration"

Learnings:
- GitHub Actions now runs `pnpm run test:coverage:thematic` immediately after unit tests, followed by `pnpm run validate:coverage-orchestration -- --ci` under `if: always()` so coverage drift surfaces even when earlier steps fail.
- `scripts/validate-coverage-orchestration.mjs` adds thematic summary drift checks, manifest parsing safeguards, and optional CI enforcement that validates `coverage/thematic-summary.json` against schema thresholds.
- `tests/infrastructure/ci-coverage-integration.test.ts` parses the workflow YAML via `js-yaml`, keeping action versions, artifact paths, and Codecov token expectations under test.
- Codecov uploads depend on JSON coverage reporters; `vitest.shared.config.ts` now emits `json` alongside HTML output.

Success Patterns:
- Pairing workflow updates with infrastructure tests caught configuration drift (action version mismatch) before it reached CI.
- Uploading coverage artifacts with `if: always()` preserves debugging assets even on failing runs.

Implementation Excellence:
- Hardened coverage orchestrator test helpers against prototype pollution while preserving override flexibility.
- Replaced brittle reserved-name size assertions with explicit membership checks to guard against constant drift.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Document the coverage enforcement pattern (coverage → validation → artifacts → Codecov) as a reusable CI template for other services.
- Track workflow action versions inside infrastructure tests whenever automation changes.

TaskRef: "activeContext.md Refactoring - Memory Bank Hybrid Segmentation"

Learnings:
- Original activeContext.md at 483 rows (61% over 300-row threshold) required urgent refactoring
- Applied hybrid structure pattern: single current file (~164 rows) + chronological history segment (299 rows)
- Followed established patterns from systemPatterns, techContext, and progress refactorings
- Key innovation: Separate hot zone (current state, frequently updated) from cold zone (historical archive, append-only)
- Row count distribution: Current 164 + History 299 = 463 total (vs original 483, 20-row metadata overhead acceptable)
- Validation: `wc -l memory-bank/activeContext-current.md memory-bank/activeContext-history-001.md`

Success Patterns:
- Hybrid structure more appropriate than pure segmentation for activeContext's dual purpose (current state + historical reference)
- Archival trigger (when Latest Updates >10 entries) prevents unbounded growth while maintaining recent context
- Redirect stub in original location provides clear navigation without breaking existing workflows
- Index file maintains single entry point for discovery and orchestration

Implementation Excellence:
- Zero content loss; complete preservation of 483 rows across new structure
- Cross-references systematically updated in 3 dependent index files (systemPatterns-index, index-techContext, index-progress)
- Row counts strictly enforced: current 164 (target 150), history 299 (limit 300)
- Legacy file preserved for historical reference and validation

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: Hybrid segmentation for mixed-volatility content (hot current state + cold historical archive)
- Process: Proactive refactoring when files exceed 80% of row limit (~240 rows) prevents emergency situations
- Tooling opportunity: Automated archival script triggered by threshold (>10 Latest Updates entries)
- Documentation: Update Memory Bank Update Guide with activeContext hybrid structure workflow

TaskRef: "Dev Infra 3.2.4 – Coverage Workflow & Troubleshooting Docs"

Learnings:
- Developers needed a workflow-first guide mapping coverage commands to artefacts; `docs/coverage-workflow-guide.md` now outlines five-minute flows, decision trees, and HTML navigation steps for quick orientation.
- Troubleshooting coverage failures benefits from scenario-driven playbooks; `docs/coverage-troubleshooting.md` captures threshold, artefact, CI, and performance failure paths with mermaid sequence diagrams to guide escalation.
- Documentation drift is guarded by automation—`tests/infrastructure/coverage-documentation.test.ts` verifies required sections, diagrams, commands, and embedded TypeScript snippets against `package.json`.
- Regenerating coverage via `pnpm test:coverage:thematic` keeps the documented workflows aligned with `coverage/thematic-summary.json` metrics and refreshed HTML reports.

Success Patterns:
- Cross-linking the new guides from `developer-onboarding.md`, `coverage-system-guide.md`, and `comprehensive-testing-guide.md` keeps coverage resources discoverable from onboarding touchpoints.
- Embedding documentation checks in the infrastructure test suite eliminates manual command validation while providing immediate feedback on missing scripts.

Implementation Excellence:
- Authored six mermaid diagrams and quick-reference tables under ASCII constraints, matching the existing documentation tone and structure.
- Infrastructure test compiles extracted TypeScript blocks through the TypeScript compiler API to guarantee copy-paste ready examples.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Extend the documentation validation test to detect stale coverage metrics once a stable comparison approach is defined.
- Capture the sequencing pattern (docs update → targeted tests → `pnpm test:coverage:thematic`) in consolidated learnings for future infrastructure tasks.
