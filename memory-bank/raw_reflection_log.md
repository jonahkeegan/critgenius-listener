TaskRef: "Dev Infra 3.3.4 - CI ESLint Workflow Guard"

Learnings:

- Leveraged `tests/infrastructure/ci-eslint-integration.test.ts` to assert `.github/workflows/ci.yml` loads dependencies before linting and fails fast on warnings.
- Documented lint guard expectations in `docs/ci-eslint-integration.md`, keeping local troubleshooting steps aligned with CI behavior.
- Re-running `pnpm run test:infrastructure` verified the workflow guard integrates cleanly with existing infrastructure checks.

Success Patterns:

- Validated YAML, scripts, and documentation together, reducing drift between CI configuration and supporting guard logic.
- Captured workflow invariants inside the infrastructure test so future CI changes surface regressions immediately.

Implementation Excellence:

- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `scripts/lint-ci.mjs` in lockstep with the new test to maintain a single authoritative lint pipeline.
- Closed the feedback loop by marking `tasks/infrastructure-setup-task-list.md` and reconfirming stability through the full infrastructure suite.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- Extend the same lint guard assertions to release and nightly workflows to prevent configuration drift outside main CI.
- Explore adding a lightweight alert when lint warnings surface locally to catch regressions before CI.
