## Raw Reflection Log - CritGenius: Listener

**Purpose:** Capture fresh, detailed reflections (tasks, learnings, discoveries, successes) prior to consolidation. This file is periodically distilled into `consolidated-learnings-XXX.md` entries per Continuous Improvement Protocol.

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Append new entries BELOW this section.
- Use the template exactly; verbose detail encouraged (pruning happens later).
- Do not remove prior entries until after a consolidation pass confirms migration.

**Entry Template:**

TaskRef: "Dev Infra Task 2.9.4 – Dev Server Validation & Documentation"

Learnings:
- Test-centric validation (unit + focused integration) yields faster, more reliable feedback than bespoke validation scripts that duplicate logic.
- Extracting dev-time functionality (env reload plugin) into its own module dramatically reduces brittleness and enables pure unit tests without global test hooks.
- Simulated HMR via react-refresh runtime offers high signal with minimal setup; acceptable to allow permissive assertions when jsdom constraints limit parity.
- Small, deterministic integration tests (HTTP proxy forwarding) provide better stability than full-stack spin-ups early in the lifecycle.
- Lint and type gates actively surfaced subtle gaps (missing `@types/react-refresh`) early, preventing CI regressions.
- Clear separation between configuration shape tests and runtime behavior tests clarifies failure modes and accelerates debugging.

Technical Discoveries:
- Direct react-refresh runtime usage in jsdom can reset state even when signatures match—environment limitation rather than logic defect.
- File watcher latency (650ms test) largely driven by chosen interval; potential optimization path via configurable debounce.
- `@ts-ignore` conversions to `@ts-expect-error` improve intentionality and lint clarity.
- Minimal mock Vite server object (ws.send + httpServer EventEmitter) is sufficient to exercise plugin hooks for reload events.
- Adding `@types/react-refresh` resolves TS7016 without needing custom ambient declarations.

Success Patterns:
- Modular extraction (plugin) + isolated unit test = lower coupling and easier future enhancements.
- Deterministic Express-based proxy forwarding test avoids race conditions of full Vite + socket.io harness.
- Explicit deferred items documented in completion report create a clear backlog for incremental hardening.
- Consistent privacy stance: no raw env value logging while still validating reload paths.
- Fast feedback loop: lint -> type-check -> targeted tests minimized iteration cycles.

Implementation Excellence:
- Clean, single-responsibility `envReloadPlugin` with optional extra watch file via env var.
- Converted fragile global injection strategy into explicit test harness mocks.
- Maintained strict ESLint zero-warning policy (replaced ignores, removed stale directives).
- Added type dependency instead of suppressing the error—aligns with strict typing principle.
- Tests parameterized with generous but bounded timeouts preventing flakiness while ensuring coverage.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Add WebSocket proxy forwarding integration (socket.io echo test) to validate upgrade path.
- Introduce performance timing assertions (warn if reload latency > threshold, e.g., 500ms) for proactive ergonomics monitoring.
- Add watcher disposal assertion (ensure no lingering FS watchers) to prevent FD leaks.
- Implement negative path proxy tests (upstream timeout, 5xx propagation, header stripping rules).
- Add real Vite-driven HMR test suite behind opt-in flag for comprehensive state preservation guarantee.
- Centralize test utilities for mock server & file watcher to reduce duplication across future dev infra tests.
- Consider instrumentation hook for measuring HMR + reload event frequency to catch regressions early.
