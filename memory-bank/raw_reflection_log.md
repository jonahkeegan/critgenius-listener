TaskRef: "Material UI Installation - Task 2.4.1 Infrastructure Setup"

Learnings:
- Context7 MCP provides excellent validation for Material UI dependency harmonization
- Material UI v7.3.1 offers React 17-19 compatibility, future-proofing the installation
- @mui/icons-material v7.3.1 provides 2000+ icons with consistent versioning to core package
- Emotion styling engine (@emotion/react@11.14.0, @emotion/styled@11.14.1) integrates seamlessly
- pnpm workspace dependency resolution works perfectly with Material UI peer dependencies

Context7 MCP Integration:
- Library ID resolution: "/mui/material-ui" for comprehensive documentation access
- Validated peer dependency requirements: React ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0
- Confirmed TypeScript compatibility and strict mode support
- Security validation passed with no vulnerabilities detected

Successes:
- All Material UI packages installed successfully in single operation
- Version alignment achieved across @mui/material and @mui/icons-material (both 7.3.1)
- Context7 MCP validation confirmed dependency stability and security
- pnpm workspace architecture maintained package isolation correctly

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Context7 MCP validation pattern for UI library dependency management
- Material UI v7 installation best practices for monorepo environments
- Peer dependency validation workflow using external knowledge sources

TaskRef: "Theme Customization for CritGenius Brand - Task 2.4.2 Infrastructure Setup"

Learnings:
- Material UI theme customization requires comprehensive understanding of palette, typography, and component overrides
- Dark mode optimization for gaming sessions benefits from deep blacks (#0D0D0D) and mystical purple branding (#6A4C93)
- Typography configuration must balance readability during long D&D sessions with aesthetic appeal
- Component overrides enable specialized audio visualization styling (waveform colors, frequency displays)
- TypeScript theme augmentation allows custom palette extensions for domain-specific colors (audio states)
- ThemeProvider and CssBaseline integration provides consistent baseline styles across the application
- Box component with responsive flexbox layout provides better compatibility than Grid component in MUI v7

Technical Implementation:
- Created comprehensive theme file (critgeniusTheme.ts) with 300+ lines of styling configuration
- Implemented color palette with 50-900 shade scales for primary (purple) and secondary (gold) colors
- Typography scale optimized for gaming sessions with proper line-height and letter-spacing
- Component overrides for Button, Card, TextField, List, IconButton, Chip, LinearProgress, Slider
- Audio-specific color palette for waveform visualization and recording states
- Successfully integrated theme into React app with working development server

Successes:
- Complete CritGenius brand identity translated into functional MUI theme
- Dark mode optimization achieved minimal eye strain for long gaming sessions  
- Responsive layout working correctly with Box flexbox approach
- Theme demo successfully showcases all brand colors and component variations
- TypeScript compatibility maintained throughout theme system
- Development server running without errors, theme applied correctly

Difficulties:
- MUI v7 Grid component API changes caused TypeScript errors requiring Box component alternative
- Grid2 import not available in current MUI version, necessitated responsive flexbox solution
- Component override syntax required careful attention to theme palette references

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- MUI v7 theme customization patterns for gaming/dark mode applications
- Component override strategies for audio visualization elements
- Responsive layout alternatives when Grid component compatibility issues arise
- Dark mode color palette design for extended user sessions
