Date: 2025-10-29 TaskRef: "Dev Infra 3.5.3 Cross-Browser E2E Smoke Tests"

Learnings:

- Replaced fragile console parsing in `packages/client/tests/e2e/transcription-display.e2e.test.ts`
  with a deterministic `window.__critgeniusSocketEvents` buffer fed by
  `packages/client/src/services/socketService.ts`, eliminating Firefox flakiness.
- Capturing emitted payloads inside `SocketService.emitTestEvent` gave Playwright deterministic
  transcript assertions without altering production pathways.

Success Patterns:

- Guarded the new event buffer behind `VITE_E2E`, keeping test-only hooks inert for real users while
  exposing complete data during automation.
- Verified the fix by rerunning `pnpm --filter @critgenius/client exec -- playwright test` across
  the six-project matrix and observing all passes.

Implementation Excellence:

- Cleared the shared event queue before each emission so assertions always inspect fresh payloads,
  preventing residue from earlier tests.
- Reused existing socket listener readiness checks to emit mock transcription events only after
  handlers registered, avoiding timing races.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- Document the `__critgeniusSocketEvents` hook in the Playwright testing guide for future smoke
  tests.
- Explore consolidating event-buffer inspection into a shared helper to reduce duplication across
  upcoming E2E specs.
