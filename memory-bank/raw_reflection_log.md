TaskRef: "Fixed Type Confusion Vulnerability in Audio Upload Endpoint"

Learnings:
- Discovered critical type confusion vulnerability in packages/server/src/index.ts line 74 where req.files was assumed to be an array without runtime validation
- Successfully implemented Array.isArray() runtime validation to prevent parameter tampering attacks
- Learned that multer's req.files can be undefined, null, or non-array types depending on upload configuration and potential malicious requests
- Refined validation logic to handle edge cases: null/undefined files (no upload) vs non-array files (malformed request)
- Added comprehensive security test suite covering various attack scenarios including malformed multipart data

Difficulties:
- Initial implementation caused test failures because type validation triggered before "No files uploaded" check
- Required careful ordering of validation checks to maintain proper error messages while ensuring security

Successes:
- Fixed critical security vulnerability that could allow type confusion attacks
- All 12 tests now pass including 4 new security-focused tests
- Implementation uses built-in JavaScript methods (no new dependencies)
- Maintains backward compatibility and existing error handling patterns
- Security fix follows defense-in-depth principles with multiple validation layers

Security Implementation Details:
- Runtime type validation prevents .map(), .length, and .reduce() calls on non-array values
- Returns appropriate HTTP 400 Bad Request status for malformed requests
- Clear error messaging without exposing system internals
- Comprehensive test coverage for security scenarios

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Security validation pattern: Always validate data types before performing operations
- Test-driven security: Write security tests to verify vulnerability fixes
- Multer edge case handling: Check for null/undefined before type validation
