TaskRef: "Task 2.6.2 - Implement basic Socket.IO server configuration with Express integration"

Learnings:
- Successfully integrated Socket.IO v4.8.1 with existing Express.js server using HTTP server wrapper pattern
- Implemented proper CORS configuration matching existing Express CORS settings for seamless client integration
- Created comprehensive TypeScript event interface definitions for type-safe real-time communication
- Established robust connection handling with proper logging and error management
- Built foundation for session-based real-time communication with room management capabilities
- Added connection state recovery for improved reliability during temporary disconnections
- Implemented structured event handling for session joining, recording control, and status updates

Technical Discoveries:
- Socket.IO v4.8.1 provides excellent built-in TypeScript support eliminating need for separate @types packages
- HTTP server wrapper pattern integrates Socket.IO seamlessly with Express without port conflicts
- Connection state recovery feature provides 2-minute disconnection tolerance for better user experience
- Event-driven architecture supports scalable real-time communication patterns
- Room-based session management enables isolated communication channels for different audio sessions

Success Patterns:
- Clean integration with existing Express middleware and routing without breaking changes
- Comprehensive logging for connection lifecycle events (connect, disconnect, errors)
- Proper error handling with structured error events sent to clients
- TypeScript type safety across all Socket.IO events and data structures
- Foundation prepared for AssemblyAI real-time streaming integration (future Task 2.6.6)
- Scalable architecture supporting multiple concurrent sessions and participants

Implementation Excellence:
- HTTP server creation pattern maintains single port usage for both HTTP and WebSocket
- CORS configuration properly aligned with existing security policies
- Event handlers organized for clear session lifecycle management
- Type definitions provide excellent IDE support and autocomplete
- Connection recovery settings optimized for real-time audio processing use cases
- Logging provides comprehensive visibility into real-time communication flows

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: Socket.IO integration with Express using HTTP server wrapper pattern
- Pattern: Real-time communication event architecture with TypeScript type safety
- Pattern: Session-based room management for isolated communication channels
- Pattern: Connection state recovery for improved reliability in real-time applications
- Pattern: Structured error handling and logging for WebSocket communication
- CritGenius Listener: Socket.IO server foundation established for robust real-time capabilities
