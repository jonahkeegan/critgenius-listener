TaskRef: "Task 3.2.1 — Tiered Coverage Enforcement"

Learnings:
- Tiered thresholds (Shared 75 %, Client/Server 50 %, Workspace/Test-Utils 30 %) stay maintainable when enforced directly in each `vitest.config.ts` and mirrored in infrastructure tests plus reporting scripts.
- CI-only coverage gates preserve developer flow while still providing strong guardrails when paired with thematic summaries and required status checks.
- Tightening Vitest global timeouts (10 s/15 s/10 s) prevents `waitFor` runaway loops without sacrificing diagnostic flexibility when suites supply explicit overrides.

Success Patterns:
- Anchored changes to Memory Bank directives so config, automation, and documentation remained in lockstep.
- Used `scripts/coverage/run-coverage.mjs` and thematic summary outputs to validate thresholds package-by-package and surface gaps quickly.
- Applied ESLint warm-up caching to stabilise slow Windows/CI runs while maintaining strict lint enforcement.

Implementation Excellence:
- Confirmed the rollout with targeted infrastructure suites and a full `pnpm -w test`, ensuring coverage, lint, and client reliability stayed green.
- Documented coverage orchestration, tier logic, and timeout adjustments across docs and knowledge stores for future maintainers.
- Rebuilt client dialog/layout tests, pushing statements beyond the 50 % gate and demonstrating tangible compliance with the new policy.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Extend smoke coverage for speaker/transcript flows to progress toward a 60 % client target in the next tranche.
- Observe ESLint regression runtimes post warm-up and tighten the 60 s ceiling once variance settles.
- Schedule regular `pnpm test:coverage:summary` runs after major merges to keep thematic dashboards and JSON output aligned.
