## Raw Reflection Log - CritGenius: Listener

**Purpose:** Capture fresh, detailed reflections (tasks, learnings, discoveries, successes) prior to
consolidation. This file is periodically distilled into `consolidated-learnings-XXX.md` entries per

Date: 2025-10-23 TaskRef: "Dev Infra 3.3.4 - CI ESLint Workflow Guard"

Learnings:

- Leveraged `tests/infrastructure/ci-eslint-integration.test.ts` to assert
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` loads dependencies before linting and fails fast on warnings.
- Documented lint guard expectations in `docs/ci-eslint-integration.md`, keeping local
  troubleshooting steps aligned with CI behavior.
- Re-running `pnpm run test:infrastructure` verified the workflow guard integrates cleanly with
  existing infrastructure checks.

Success Patterns:

- Validated YAML, scripts, and documentation together, reducing drift between CI configuration and
  supporting guard logic.
- Captured workflow invariants inside the infrastructure test so future CI changes surface
  regressions immediately.

Implementation Excellence:

- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `scripts/lint-ci.mjs` in lockstep with the new test to
  maintain a single authoritative lint pipeline.
- Closed the feedback loop by marking `tasks/infrastructure-setup-task-list.md` and reconfirming
  stability through the full infrastructure suite.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- Extend the same lint guard assertions to release and nightly workflows to prevent configuration
  drift outside main CI.
- Explore adding a lightweight alert when lint warnings surface locally to catch regressions before
  CI.

Date: 2025-10-25 TaskRef: "Dev Infra 3.3.5 - CI ESLint Documentation"

Learnings:

- Centralizing lint knowledge in `docs/eslint-guide.md` makes it easier for developers to find
  workflows, rule rationales, and troubleshooting tips without hopping across multiple docs.
- Providing a direct onboarding pointer in `docs/developer-onboarding.md` should reduce ramp-up time
  for new contributors dealing with ESLint requirements.
- Visualizing lint lifecycles with Mermaid diagrams clarified how local commands, pre-commit hooks,
  CI runs, and IDE feedback interconnect.

Success Patterns:

- Followed the documentation style established in existing guides (tables, callouts, diagrams) to
  keep the lint guide consistent with reader expectations.
- Reinforced discoverability by cross-linking related docs instead of duplicating content, keeping
  updates scoped to single sources of truth.

Implementation Excellence:

- Structured the new guide around actionable sections (quick start, configuration overview,
  workflows, troubleshooting) so it aligns with daily developer needs rather than theory.
- Ensured all six diagrams map directly to the task plan, maintaining a one-to-one relationship
  between documented workflows and visual references.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- Consider adding a documentation validation or link-check script to keep cross-references (e.g.,
  `docs/eslint-guide.md`) from drifting.
- Future onboarding updates should summarize when to escalate lint issues to infra, referencing the
  new guide to maintain shared expectations.

Date: 2025-10-26 TaskRef: "Dev Infra 3.4.1 - VSCode Prettier Format-on-Save Configuration"

Learnings:

- Workspace-level `.vscode/settings.json` ensures Prettier runs on save across
  TS/JS/JSON/Markdown/YAML while leaving ESLint fixes explicit for predictable edits.
- `.vscode/extensions.json` recommendations prompt installation of Prettier, ESLint, and TypeScript
  nightly so contributors close the loop between settings and tooling.
- Embedding a VS Code setup section inside `docs/developer-onboarding.md` gives new developers a
  one-stop checklist for verifying format-on-save behavior.

Success Patterns:

- Reused repository onboarding conventions (short checklists and troubleshooting bullets) to keep
  the new documentation aligned with established guides.
- Treated VS Code configuration files as first-class artifacts by adjusting `.gitignore`, ensuring
  workspace preferences live alongside source control.

Implementation Excellence:

- Scoped Prettier defaults per language to avoid regressions for JSON, Markdown, and YAML formatting
  while preserving `prettier.requireConfig` for safety.
- Standardized LF newlines and final newline trimming in the workspace settings so cross-OS
  collaborators avoid formatting churn.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- Consider adding an automated check to flag when the Prettier extension is missing during
  onboarding dry runs or dev container builds.
- Future documentation updates could capture non-VS Code editor setups (WebStorm/Vim) in a shared
  appendix to extend the guidance beyond VS Code.
