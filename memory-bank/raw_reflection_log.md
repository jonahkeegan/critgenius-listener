# Raw Reflection Log - CritGenius: Listener

**Purpose:** Initial detailed capture of task reflections, learnings, difficulties, and successes. Raw entries here are candidates for later consolidation into consolidated-learnings files.

**Usage:** Add timestamped, task-referenced entries after completing tasks or gaining significant insights. Keep entries detailed and comprehensive - pruning happens during consolidation.

**Structure:** Each entry should include:
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- TaskRef (descriptive task reference)
- Learnings (key discoveries and insights)
- Technical Discoveries (specific technical findings)
- Success Patterns (what worked well)
- Implementation Excellence (noteworthy implementation details)
- Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation (patterns ready for consolidation)

*This file is ready for new task reflections. Add entries above this line using the established format.*

TaskRef: 2.6.10 — Validate AssemblyAI ↔ Socket.IO real-time integration (no live API key)
Learnings:
- We can validate ~90% of the realtime pipeline via mocks: control signals, transcript normalization, status events, and lifecycle.
- Keeping normalization logic server-side (SessionManager) simplifies client responsibilities and typings.
- Hoisted test mocks are essential when mocking imports consumed by module init side-effects.
Technical Discoveries:
- AssemblyAI realtime expects base64 PCM in JSON { audio_data }, and our connector handles Uint8Array/string seamlessly.
- The WebSocket mock must set OPEN state (like ws.OPEN) to activate send path; adding static OPEN=1 in tests is sufficient.
- Vitest’s vi.hoisted prevents TDZ errors when mocks are referenced during module load (used for SessionManager mock in server wiring test).
Success Patterns:
- Clear separation of concerns: SessionManager bridges Socket.IO and Connector, enabling targeted tests.
- Robust event mapping: start/stop/audioChunk, transcriptionUpdate, transcriptionStatus, error codes.
- Session cleanup on last participant ensures connectors close and resources free.
Implementation Excellence:
- Added focused unit tests for connector base64 and event handling.
- Added SessionManager tests covering error paths, normalization, and lifecycle.
- Ensured type safety and strict TS by addressing undefined guards and non-null assertions in tests.
Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Add an optional E2E smoke test (skipped in CI) that uses a real key for final verification.
- Expose a small client UI indicator reacting to transcriptionStatus for better UX diagnostics.
- Introduce coverage thresholds to guard regressions in realtime code paths.
