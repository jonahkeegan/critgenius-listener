# Raw Reflection Log - CritGenius: Listener

**Purpose:** Initial detailed capture of task reflections, learnings, difficulties, and successes. Raw entries here are candidates for later consolidation into consolidated-learnings files.

**Usage:** Add timestamped, task-referenced entries after completing tasks or gaining significant insights. Keep entries detailed and comprehensive - pruning happens during consolidation.

**Structure:** Each entry should include:
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- TaskRef (descriptive task reference)
- Learnings (key discoveries and insights)
- Technical Discoveries (specific technical findings)
- Success Patterns (what worked well)
- Implementation Excellence (noteworthy implementation details)
- Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation (patterns ready for consolidation)

TaskRef: "Task 2.8.1: Install Husky and lint-staged for pre-commit automation"

Learnings:
- Maintaining lightweight hooks (ESLint + Prettier only) preserves developer velocity while still preventing nearly all formatting/lint CI failures.
- Adding shebangs to Husky scripts avoids shell resolution issues across Windows (Git Bash) and Unix.
- Centralizing lint-staged config in root `package.json` keeps monorepo maintenance simpler than per-package configs, given consistent tooling.

Technical Discoveries:
- Existing dependencies already satisfied requirements; focus shifted to hardening scripts and documentation instead of re-installation.
- Conventional Commit enforcement via `commit-msg` hook provides early feedback and reduces PR churn.
- stderr redirection in the commit message hook improves clarity inside some Git clients that suppress stdout on failure.

Success Patterns:
- Documentation (`docs/pre-commit-workflow.md`) accelerates contributor onboarding and clarifies extension points (type-check/tests optional).
- Explicit skip guidance (`--no-verify`) reduces temptation for ad-hoc hook edits.
- Completion report template streamlines traceability for infra tasks.

Implementation Excellence:
- Added descriptive comments in hooks for future maintainers.
- Ensured patterns align with Memory Bank quality gate expectations (fast, deterministic, privacy-awareâ€”no secret logging).
- Hook changes avoided introducing runtime dependencies or altering existing build/test flows.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Introduce optional run-once type-check via JS-based lint-staged config when codebase size grows.
- Add secret scanning (git-secrets or trufflehog-lite) as a future lightweight hook.
- Potential selective test invocation for touched packages using `--filter` logic.
