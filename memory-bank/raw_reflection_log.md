## Raw Reflection Log - CritGenius: Listener

**Purpose:** Capture fresh, detailed reflections (tasks, learnings, discoveries, successes) prior to consolidation. This file is periodically distilled into `consolidated-learnings-XXX.md` entries per Continuous Improvement Protocol.

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Append new entries BELOW this section.
- Use the template exactly; verbose detail encouraged (pruning happens later).
- Do not remove prior entries until after a consolidation pass confirms migration.

**Entry Template:**
```
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
TaskRef: "<Task ID / Descriptive Title>"

Learnings:
- <bullet>

Technical Discoveries:
- <bullet>

Success Patterns:
- <bullet>

Implementation Excellence:
- <bullet>

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

```
