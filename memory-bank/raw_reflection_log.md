TaskRef: "Task 3.2.1 — Tiered Coverage Enforcement"

Learnings:
- Tiered thresholds (Shared 75 %, Client/Server 50 %, Workspace/Test-Utils 30 %) stay maintainable when enforced directly in each `vitest.config.ts` and mirrored in infrastructure tests plus reporting scripts.
- CI-only coverage gates preserve developer flow while still providing strong guardrails when paired with thematic summaries and required status checks.
- Tightening Vitest global timeouts (10 s/15 s/10 s) prevents `waitFor` runaway loops without sacrificing diagnostic flexibility when suites supply explicit overrides.

Success Patterns:
- Anchored changes to Memory Bank directives so config, automation, and documentation remained in lockstep.
- Used `scripts/coverage/run-coverage.mjs` and thematic summary outputs to validate thresholds package-by-package and surface gaps quickly.
- Applied ESLint warm-up caching to stabilise slow Windows/CI runs while maintaining strict lint enforcement.

Implementation Excellence:
- Confirmed the rollout with targeted infrastructure suites and a full `pnpm -w test`, ensuring coverage, lint, and client reliability stayed green.
- Documented coverage orchestration, tier logic, and timeout adjustments across docs and knowledge stores for future maintainers.
- Rebuilt client dialog/layout tests, pushing statements beyond the 50 % gate and demonstrating tangible compliance with the new policy.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Extend smoke coverage for speaker/transcript flows to progress toward a 60 % client target in the next tranche.
- Observe ESLint regression runtimes post warm-up and tighten the 60 s ceiling once variance settles.
- Schedule regular `pnpm test:coverage:summary` runs after major merges to keep thematic dashboards and JSON output aligned.

TaskRef: "Task 3.2.1.1 – Centralized Coverage Configuration"

Learnings:
- Establishing `config/coverage.config.mjs` as the single coverage authority prevents threshold drift across scripts, Vitest configs, and validation suites while keeping new package onboarding lightweight.
- Loading the shared module via `pathToFileURL` keeps both Node and jsdom environments happy, eliminating ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME noise during infrastructure runs.
- Infrastructure tests deliver real value when they assert against the centralized config rather than copied literals, transforming them into drift detectors instead of maintenance burdens.

Success Patterns:
- Refactored coverage scripts and Vitest configs together, validating changes with targeted infrastructure suites before doing full runs.
- Leveraged watchexec (explicit executable path + repo-root cwd) for rapid feedback on config edits without triggering relative-path failures.
- Preserved type safety by pairing the module with dedicated `.d.ts` typings and shared interfaces so every consumer stays aligned.

Implementation Excellence:
- Introduced thresholds, reports directories, and execution order metadata in a single pass, giving downstream tooling everything needed from the centralized module.
- Executed `pnpm vitest run tests/infrastructure/coverage-thresholds.test.ts tests/infrastructure/coverage-validation.test.ts` to confirm every package honors the shared thresholds before closing the task.
- Documented the architectural change via the completion report and synced the Memory Bank so future contributors understand the new flow.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Promote other coverage consumers (dashboards, CI summaries) to import the shared module instead of parsing output artifacts.
- Wrap the watchexec workflow in an npm script to make iterative coverage edits easier for the broader team.
- Evaluate adding schema validation (e.g., Zod) around the configuration to guard against malformed entries as new themes appear.
