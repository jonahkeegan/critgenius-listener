# Product Context - CritGenius: Listener

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-08 20:08 PST **Version:** 2.0.0 **Dependencies:** projectbrief.md

## Product Purpose

CritGenius: Listener revolutionizes live tabletop roleplaying experiences by providing seamless,
real-time audio capture and transcription, mapping every voice to its player and character. It
serves as the intelligent backbone for AI-driven session augmentation, enabling richer storytelling,
effortless content creation, and transformative in-game support for every Dungeons & Dragons (D&D)
tableâ€”virtual or physical.

## Problem Statement

D&D players, Dungeon Masters, and content creators face significant challenges in capturing and
organizing live session experiences:

**Core Problems:**

- **Session Documentation**: Manual note-taking disrupts gameplay and leads to incomplete records
- **Memory Loss**: Critical story details and character interactions are forgotten between sessions
- **Content Creation Barriers**: Streamers and creators lack tools for real-time transcription and
  accessible content
- **Administrative Overhead**: DMs struggle to track complex narratives while managing multiple
  characters
- **Accessibility Gaps**: Live sessions lack real-time captions and searchable archives

**Market Gap**: No existing solution offers real-time, D&D-specific audio capture with
speaker-to-character mapping and extensibility for AI features.
