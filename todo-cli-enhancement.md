# CLI Tools Enhancement Task - Todo List

## Step 1: Task Plan Analysis

- [x] Read task plan file
- [x] Parse content for CLI operations (grep, find, cat, etc.)
- [x] Identify command-line patterns and file operations

## Step 2: CLI Tools Reference Setup

- [x] Load CLI utilities guide
- [x] Build substitution map (standard → modern tools)
- [x] Create internal reference for tool capabilities

## Step 3: Opportunity Identification

- [x] Scan task plan line by line for CLI tool usage
- [x] Match operations to modern alternatives
- [x] Categorize opportunities by impact (high/medium/low)

## Step 4: Enhancement Implementation

- [x] Apply fd enhancement for file discovery
- [x] Apply ripgrep (rg) enhancement for content search
- [x] Apply watchexec enhancement for automatic testing
- [x] Apply bat enhancement for file viewing
- [ ] Add procs enhancement for process monitoring (optional)
- [ ] Add ast-grep enhancement for code analysis (optional)

## Step 5: Index Updates & Completion

- [x] No new tools discovered (used index-based substitutions)
- [x] Complete with comprehensive summary
- [x] Provide installation and usage guidance

## CLI Tools Successfully Integrated

- [x] fd - 3-10x faster file discovery
- [x] ripgrep (rg) - 2-5x faster content search
- [x] watchexec - 50%+ time savings in development
- [x] bat - Syntax highlighting and git integration
