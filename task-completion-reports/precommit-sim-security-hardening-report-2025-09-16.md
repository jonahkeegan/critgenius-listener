# Task Completion Report: Pre-commit Simulation Security Hardening (2025-09-16)

## Overview
Objective: Address CodeQL finding (`js/shell-command-injection-from-environment`) in `scripts/precommit-simulate.mjs` while preserving existing behavioral guarantees:
- Clean scenario passes (exit 0)
- Negative scenarios (`lint-error`, `format-error`, `type-error`) deterministically fail prior to auto-fix masking
- No regression to previously stabilized infra tests

## Initial Issue
CodeQL flagged dynamic shell command construction:
```
execSync(`npx tsc --project ${tmpDir}/tsconfig.json --noEmit`, ...)
```
Risk: Interpolated path values (even if internally generated) could allow accidental shell interpretation on shells where whitespace or special characters might alter execution semantics.

## Constraints & Acceptance Criteria
| Requirement | Rationale | Status |
| ----------- | --------- | ------ |
| Remove dynamic command interpolation for tools (eslint, prettier, tsc) | Mitigate command injection class | Done |
| Preserve lint-staged flow (hook parity) | Ensures simulation fidelity | Done |
| Keep forced failure logic for negative scenarios | Prevent false positives | Done |
| Avoid reintroducing prior Vitest worker timeout issue | Test stability | Done |
| Conventional Commit for fix | Repo policy | Done |

## Remediation Strategy
1. Replace interpolated shell invocations for diagnostics with `execFileSync` + argument arrays (no shell parsing).
2. Retain a single static `execSync` for `npx lint-staged` (constant command string; no untrusted interpolation). Potential future hardening: resolve direct binary path.
3. Preserve temp `tsconfig.json` generation for isolated type checking.
4. Maintain forced failure override (pre-diagnostics determine scenario expectation) so auto-fix (ESLint/Prettier) does not mask failures.
5. Keep silent mode behavior (`CG_PRECOMMIT_SIM_SILENT`) intact to reduce output noise in CI.

## Iteration Timeline (Key Changes)
| Step | Change | Result |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Introduced argument-array execFileSync for eslint/prettier/tsc | Addressed injection surfaces |
| 2 | Attempted full replacement of lint-staged with ad hoc eslint/prettier execution | Broke parity; clean scenario failed |
| 3 | Attempted direct binary + pnpm exec fallback for lint-staged (Windows EINVAL/ENOENT issues) | Spawn errors persisted |
| 4 | Reverted to stable original pattern for hook simulation while keeping secure diagnostics | Restored clean pass |
| 5 | Consolidated final script: minimal diff, secure execFileSync for dynamic args only | All scenarios behave as intended |

## Final Script Characteristics
- Uses `execFileSync('eslint', [...files])`, `execFileSync('prettier', ['--check', ...files])`, `execFileSync('tsc', ['--project', path, '--noEmit'])`.
- Single static command: `npx lint-staged` (low risk; no variable interpolation) preserves real hook semantics.
- Forced failure logic unchanged.
- Cleanup (`git reset HEAD .`) leaves repo pristine post-execution.

## Verification
| Aspect | Method | Outcome |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Clean scenario | `node scripts/precommit-simulate.mjs clean` | Passed (✅) |
| lint-error scenario | Direct run | Failed as expected (❌) |
| format-error scenario | Direct run | Failed as expected (❌) |
| type-error scenario | Direct run | Failed as expected (❌) |
| Type-check gating | Observed `pnpm -w type-check` run only when TS files staged | Working |
| Regression tests | Full suite (previously passing baseline) | No new systemic failures introduced (infra test will reflect scenario results) |

## Security Considerations
- Eliminated dynamic shell interpolation around file path arguments.
- Residual `execSync` risk deemed acceptable (static literal with optional `--quiet`).
- Future enhancement: resolve `lint-staged` binary directly (`node_modules/.bin/lint-staged`) then call via `execFileSync` to fully remove last `execSync` usage.

## Trade-offs
| Decision | Trade-off | Justification |
| -------- | --------- | ------------- |
| Keep `execSync` for lint-staged | Minor residual static shell usage | Preserves exact hook semantics quickly; can be iterated later |
| Avoid custom reimplementation of lint-staged pipeline | Less granular control | Maintains fidelity, reduces maintenance burden |

## Follow-up Recommendations
1. OPTIONAL: Replace `execSync('npx lint-staged...')` with direct binary resolution (Windows-compatible) using `execFileSync`.
2. Add a lightweight unit test targeting only the simulation script (clean + one negative) to shorten feedback loop vs. full infra test.
3. Introduce environment flag to skip type-check for performance benchmarking runs if needed.
4. Add CodeQL suppression comment ONLY if scanner continues to flag static `execSync` (should not be necessary).

## Commit Reference
- Security fix commit: `6c0d33c` (`fix(security): mitigate shell interpolation risk in precommit simulation script`).

## Completion Criteria Met
- [x] Vulnerability mitigated
- [x] Behavioral parity preserved
- [x] Negative scenarios deterministic
- [x] Code style & commit conventions adhered to
- [x] Documentation (this report) added

## Conclusion
The pre-commit simulation script is now hardened against shell command injection patterns while retaining functional accuracy and test determinism. Remaining minor hardening (replacing the final static `execSync`) is low priority and documented.
