# Dev Infra Task 2.9.4 – Development Server Documentation Refactor & Validation Suite Completion Report

## Summary
Refactored `docs/development-server.md` from a mixed, partially duplicated draft into a structured, test‑backed developer guide. Introduced an automated documentation integrity test to prevent future drift and integrated it into the existing test workflow. Memory Bank updated with reflections and context alignment.

## Objectives & Outcomes
| Objective | Implementation | Result |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Remove legacy / placeholder content | Rewrote entire doc with clear sections & tables | ✅ Clean guide, no placeholder text |
| Provide fast navigability | Added At a Glance + Table of Contents | ✅ Easier scanning |
| Encode behavior in tests (not prose) | Summarized behaviors; pointed to tests | ✅ Reduced drift risk |
| Add structural validation | New Vitest doc integrity test | ✅ Failing build if sections regress |
| Preserve privacy & security posture | Explicit section + no secret exposure | ✅ Compliant |
| Traceability & learning capture | Updated `activeContext.md` & `raw_reflection_log.md` | ✅ Knowledge continuity |

## Key Changes
1. Replaced outdated `development-server.md` with structured sections: overview, quick start, concepts, configuration matrix, validation harness, workflows, troubleshooting, roadmap, security, file map, sequence diagrams.
2. Added sequence diagrams (env reload, proxy decision flow, doc validation lifecycle) satisfying protocol consistency.
3. Added `tests/docs/development-server-doc.test.ts` ensuring:
   - Required headings exist
   - Configuration matrix header present
   - Minimum sequence diagram count (>=3)
   - No deprecated placeholder markers
4. Updated root `package.json` test script to run recursive package tests then a root Vitest pass (ensuring doc tests execute). Added `test:docs` convenience script.
5. Memory Bank updates:
   - `activeContext.md` – documented doc refactor completion + integrity test
   - `raw_reflection_log.md` – appended additional insights on doc automation

## Rationale
- Embedding validation in automated tests enforces documentation fidelity without manual auditing.
- Structured layout reduces cognitive load and accelerates onboarding / troubleshooting.
- Separation of “summary” versus “truth in tests” aligns with strategy to minimize narrative drift.

## Sequence Diagram Coverage
| Diagram | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Env Reload Lifecycle | Visualizes watcher → WS full reload path |
| Proxy Decision Flow | Clarifies conditional proxy target resolution |
| Documentation Validation | Shows test-driven doc integrity process |

## Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Doc drift after future feature additions | Integrity test will fail if headings/table removed |
| Over-specific tests causing churn | Only anchors + core structure asserted, not wording |
| Hidden secret leakage during edits | Privacy section plus existing env projection tests guard |
| Incomplete future enhancements misinterpreted as implemented | Roadmap section explicitly marks deferred items |

## Deferred / Follow-Up Items
| Item | Reason for Deferral |
|------|--------------------|
| WebSocket proxy forwarding test | Await socket harness to avoid flakiness |
| Real Vite HMR latency instrumentation | Premature without baseline metrics harness |
| Negative path proxy tests | Add after upstream error simulation utilities exist |
| Watcher disposal verification | Will add when resource leak tooling added |
| Performance metrics export (cold start / first patch) | Needs stable baseline first |

## Validation
- All tests (including new doc test) passing.
- No lint or type errors introduced (markdown + test only).
- Commit: `feat(docs): refactor development server guide with validation test (task 2.9.4)`.

## Metrics (Qualitative)
| Aspect | Previous State | New State |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| Structural clarity | Fragmented | Hierarchical & indexed |
| Automated guarantees | None | Headings + diagrams + matrix validated |
| Troubleshooting guidance | Minimal | Explicit matrix |
| Future work visibility | Implicit bullets | Explicit roadmap table |

## Implementation Notes
- Chose minimal assertion set in doc test to balance safety vs. flexibility.
- Avoided external markdown parser dependency (simple string assertions sufficient and faster).
- Retained existing environment schema references to avoid duplication.

## Memory Bank Impact
- Ensures future contributors understand rationale for test-centric documentation pattern.
- Provides artifact for continuous improvement process referencing doc automation pattern.

## Next Suggested Increment
Implement WebSocket proxy forwarding integration test (socket.io echo) and extend doc test to validate internal anchor links when socket harness stabilizes.

## Completion Status
✅ Task 2.9.4 Documentation Refactor & Validation fully implemented.
