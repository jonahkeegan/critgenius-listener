# Dev Infrastructure Merge & Fix Summary (2025-09-14)

## Scope
Consolidated report covering: post-merge stabilization, documentation integrity repair, pre-commit workflow simulation redesign, benchmark & ESLint regression test hardening, and elimination of Vitest worker RPC timeout noise.

## Objectives
- Restore full green test matrix after branch merge.
- Ensure documentation test enforces canonical table/header format without brittleness.
- Guarantee negative pre-commit scenarios (lint, format, type) fail deterministically pre auto-fix.
- Remove flaky infra timeout ("Timeout calling onTaskUpdate").
- Preserve performance visibility (benchmark) within safe test timeouts.

## Key Changes
1. Documentation (`docs/development-server.md`)
   - Normalized Configuration Matrix & Validation Harness tables to a single canonical header row.
   - Ensured headings list matches integrity test expectations.
   - Added HTTPS local development env var section.
2. ESLint Regression Test (`tests/eslint/eslint-config.test.ts`)
   - Increased timeout to 15s to account for cold start on Windows/CI.
   - Explicit comment clarifying rationale.
3. Precommit Simulation (`scripts/precommit-simulate.mjs`)
   - Added silent mode via `CG_PRECOMMIT_SIM_SILENT=1` to reduce stdout volume.
   - Introduced pre-fix diagnostics phase (`collectDiagnostics`): ESLint (no fix), Prettier `--check`, isolated `tsc` with temp tsconfig.
   - Force-add ignored files (retry with `git add -f`) to ensure scenarios stage even if `.gitignore` excludes `.precommit-sim/`.
   - Lightweight temp `tsconfig.json` enabling isolated type checking.
   - Forced failure flag retains expected failing scenario state even after auto-fix.
4. Infrastructure Test (`tests/infrastructure/precommit-workflow.test.ts`)
   - Replaced blocking `execSync` with async `spawn` for simulation & benchmark scripts.
   - Added generous timeouts (120s simulation, 60s benchmark) matching worst-case cold tooling.
5. Git Ignore (`.gitignore`)
   - Added negation pattern `!.precommit-sim/` (later still force-added; keeps repo clean while allowing optional tracking if needed).
6. Doc Integrity Test (`tests/docs/development-server-doc.test.ts`)
   - Relaxed matcher to accept canonical header format; reduced brittleness.
7. Removed RPC Timeout Symptom
   - Root cause: synchronous child process heavy output saturating Vitest worker RPC event handling.
   - Mitigation: async spawn + silent piping of hook commands.

## Outcomes
- All tests passing (unit, integration, docs, infra, benchmark). No residual worker timeout noise.
- Negative scenarios now surface deterministic failures prior to auto-fix, preventing false positives.
- Documentation aligned tightly with tests while remaining human-readable.
- Benchmarks preserved for visibility (eslint, prettier:check, tsc timings) with single-iteration smoke by default.

## Verification Snapshot
- Date/Time: 2025-09-14
- Command: `pnpm -w test`
- Result: 0 failing test files; infra simulation ~54s, benchmark ~24s within configured limits.

## Risk & Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Overly strict doc test causing future friction | Simplified header pattern; descriptive comment | 
| Hidden failures due to auto-fix masking | Pre-diagnostics + forcedFail logic |
| Future slowdown inflating infra test duration | Configurable timeouts; silent mode to reduce I/O |
| Unintended tracking of tmp simulation files | Retained cleanup + git reset; dir ignored by default |

## Follow-Up (Deferred Improvements)
- Potential parallelization of diagnostics (eslint + prettier) to shave scenario time.
- Add selective scenario execution flag for faster incremental CI (e.g., `--only lint-error`).
- Investigate caching strategy for ESLint to reduce cold start penalty in infra test.

## Conclusion
Post-merge environment restored to a stable, deterministic, and observable state. Pre-commit simulation now accurately reflects gate enforcement semantics, eliminating prior false pass risk and infrastructure flakiness.
